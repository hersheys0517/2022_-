Analysts have uncovered an Iran-linked APT sending malicious emails to top Israeli government officials.

An advanced persistent threat group, with ties to Iran, is believed behind a phishing campaign targeting high-profile government and military Israeli personnel, according to a report by Check Point Software.

Targets of the campaign included a senior leadership in the Israeli defense industry, the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Israel.

The goal of the campaign, the researchers said, was to obtain personal information from targets.

Fake Emails from Legit Addresses
One of the targets, according to Check Point, is Tzipi Livni, Israel’s former foreign minister, minister of justice and vice prime minister. Researchers believe that the target was selected because of the high-caliber list of contacts in her address book.

Not long ago she received an email from, according to the researchers, “a well-known former Major General in the IDF who served in a highly sensitive position.” The sender address was not spoofed – it was the same domain she’d corresponded with before. Translated from Hebrew, the message read:

Hello my dear friends, Please see attached article to summarize the year. ((*eyes only*)) Of course I don’t want it to be distributed, because it is not the final version. I would be happy to receive remarks of any kind. Have a great rest of the day.

The message contained a link. Livni delayed in clicking the link, prompting several follow-up emails.

Good morning, I haven’t heard from you. Some friends sent me remarks. Your remarks are also very important to me. I know you are very busy. But I wanted to ask you to take your time and read the article. Good week

The persistence of the sender and flurry of messages raised her suspicions, according to Check Point. After Livni met with the former Major General, it became clear that the emails were sent from a compromised account and the contents of the messages were part of a phishing attack.

It was a similar story for the other targets in this campaign – suspect emails were being sent from legitimate contacts.

What Really Happened
The method of attack wasn’t particularly technical. “The most sophisticated part of the operation is the social engineering,” Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Research, noted. He said, the campaign was “a very targeted phishing chain that is specifically crafted for each target.” Personally crafted phishing emails is a technique called spear phishing.

The attackers initiated their spear phishing attacks, first by compromising an email address book belonging to a contact of their target. Then, using the hijacked account, they’d continue an already existing email chain between the contact and the target. In time, they’d steer the conversation towards conning the target to clicking on or opening a malicious link or document.

“Some of the emails include a link to a real document that is relevant to the target,” Check Point’s analysts noted. For example, an “invitation to a conference or research, phishing page of Yahoo, link to upload document scans.”

“The goal,” in the end, was “to steal their personal information, passport scans, and steal access to their mail accounts.”

Who and Why
“We have solid evidence that it started at least from December 2021,” Shykevich wrote, “but we assume that it started earlier.”

In their analysis, the researchers found evidence they believe points to the Iran-linked Phosphorus APT group (a.k.a. Charming Kitten, Ajax Security, NewsBeef, APT35). Phosphorus is one of Iran’s most active APTs, with “a long history of conducting high-profile cyber operations, aligned with the interest of the Iranian regime, as well as targeting Israeli officials.”

Iran and Israel are usually at odds, and these attacks came “in the midst of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. With recent assassinations of Iranian officials (some affiliated with the Israeli’s Mossad), and the thwarted attempts to kidnap Israeli citizens worldwide, we suspect that Phosphorous will continue with its ongoing efforts in the future.”"

Business Email Compromise
Attackers used adversary-in-the-middle attacks to steal passwords, hijack sign-in sessions and skip authentication and then use victim mailboxes to launch BEC attacks against other targets.

Microsoft researchers have uncovered a massive phishing campaign that can steal credentials even if a user has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled and has so far attempted to compromise more than 10,000 organizations.

The campaign, which has been active since September 2021, depends upon the use of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing sites in the initial attacks to hijack session cookies and steal credentials. From there, attackers can access victims’ user mailboxes to launch further attacks against other targets, the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MTIC) wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

In AiTM attacks, a threat actor deploys a proxy server between a target user and the website the user wishes to visit–that is, the site the attacker wishes to impersonate, researchers explained.

“Such a setup allows the attacker to steal and intercept the target’s password and the session cookie that proves their ongoing and authenticated session with the website,” they wrote.

It’s important to point out that this type of attack does not denote a vulnerability in the type of MFA employed by a corporate email system, they added. AiTM phishing steals the session cookie, so the attacker gets authenticated to a session on the user’s behalf regardless of the sign-in method the latter uses, researchers said.

Indeed, attackers are getting wise to organizations’ increasing use of MFA to better secure user accounts and creating more sophisticated phishing attacks like these that can bypass it, noted a security professional.

“While MFA is certainly valuable and should be used when possible, by capturing the password and session cookie–and because the session cookie shows that MFA was already used to login–the attackers can often circumvent the need for MFA when they login to the account again later using the stolen password,” observed Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at security awareness training firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.

AiTM Phishing, Unpacked
In their observation of the campaign, Microsoft researchers took a deeper dive into how these types of attacks work and how they can be used to mount secondary business email compromise (BEC) attacks once initial access to someone’s account is gained, they said.

AiTM phishing attacks depend upon the session that every modern web service implements with a user after successful authentication so that the user doesn’t have to be authenticated at every new page they visit, researchers explained.

“This session functionality is implemented through a session cookie provided by an authentication service after initial authentication,” they wrote. “The session cookie is proof for the web server that the user has been authenticated and has an ongoing session on the website.”

In AiTM phishing, an attacker attempts to steal a target user’s session cookie so they can skip the whole authentication process and act as if they are the legitimate authenticated user, researchers said.

“To do this, the attacker deploys a webserver that proxies HTTP packets from the user that visits the phishing site to the target server the attacker wishes to impersonate and the other way around,” they wrote. “This way, the phishing site is visually identical to the original website (as every HTTP is proxied to and from the original website).”

This attack is especially convenient for threat actors because it precludes the need for them to craft their own phishing sites such as the ones used in conventional phishing campaigns, researchers noted.

Specific Attack Vector
In the phishing campaign observed by Microsoft researchers, attackers initiate contact with potential victims by sending emails with an HTML file attachment to multiple recipients in different organizations. The messages claim that the recipients have a voicemail message and need to click on the attachment to access it or it will be deleted in 24 hours.

If a user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a site that tells them they will be redirected again to their mailbox with the audio in an hour. Meanwhile, they are asked to sign in with their credentials.

At this point, however, the attack does something unique using clever coding by automatically filling in the phishing landing page with the user’s email address, “thus enhancing its social engineering lure,” researchers noted.

If a target enters his or her credentials and gets authenticated, he or she is redirected to the legitimate Microsoft office.com page. However, in the background, the attacker intercepts the credentials and gets authenticated on the user’s behalf, providing free reign to perform follow-on activities, researchers said.

In the phishing email chain that researchers observed, the threat actor used the authentication to commit payment fraud in secondary attacks from within the organization, researchers said.

Follow-Up BEC and Payment Fraud
Attackers took less than five minutes after hijacking sessions and stealing credentials to begin the process of conducting payment fraud by authenticating to Outlook to access finance-related emails and file attachments, researchers said. The following day, they accessed these emails and files every few hours to search for opportunities to commit fraud.

The threat actor also deleted from the compromised account’s Inbox folder the original phishing email they sent to hide traces of their initial access, researchers added.

“These activities suggest the attacker attempted to commit payment fraud manually,” they wrote.

Attackers also used Outlook Web Access (OWA) on a Chrome browser to commit payment fraud while using the compromised account’s stolen session cookie, researchers added."

Victims instructed to make a phone call that will direct them to a link for downloading malware.

A new callback phishing campaign is impersonating prominent security companies to try to trick potential victims into making a phone call that will instruct them to download malware.

Researchers at CrowdStrike Intelligence discovered the campaign because CrowdStrike is actually one of the companies, among other security firms, being impersonated, they said in a recent blog post.

The campaign employs a typical phishing email aiming to fool a victim into replying with urgency—in this case, implying that the recipient’s company has been breached and insisting that they call a phone number included in the message, researchers wrote. If a person targeted calls the number, they reach someone who directs them to a website with malicious intent, they said.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

“Historically, callback campaign operators attempt to persuade victims to install commercial RAT software to gain an initial foothold on the network,” researchers wrote in the post.

Researchers likened the campaign to one discovered last year dubbed BazarCall by the Wizard Spider threat group. That campaign used a similar tactic to try to spur people to make a phone call to opt-out of renewing an online service the recipient purportedly is currently using, Sophos researchers explained at the time.

If people made the call, a friendly person on the other side would give them a website address where the soon-to-be victim could supposedly unsubscribe from the service. However, that website instead led them to a malicious download.

CrowdStrike also identified a campaign in March of this year in which threat actors used a callback phishing campaign to install AteraRMM followed by Cobalt Strike to assist with lateral movement and deploy additional malware, CrowdStrike researchers said.

Impersonating a Trusted Partner
Researchers did not specify what other security companies were being impersonated in the campaign, which they identified on July 8, they said. In their blog post, they included a screenshot of the email sent to recipients impersonating CrowdStrike, which appears legitimate by using the company’s logo.

Specifically, the email informs the target that it’s coming from their company’s “outsourced data security services vendor,” and that “abnormal activity” has been detected on the “segment of the network which your workstation is a part of.”

The message claims that the victim’s IT department already has been notified but that their participation is required to perform an audit on their individual workstation, according to CrowdStrike. The email instructs the recipient to call a number provided so this can be done, which is when the malicious activity occurs.

Though researchers were not able to identify the malware variant being used in the campaign, they believe with high likelihood that it will include “common legitimate remote administration tools (RATs) for initial access, off-the-shelf penetration testing tools for lateral movement, and the deployment of ransomware or data extortion,” they wrote.

Potential to Spread Ransomware
Researchers also assessed with “moderate confidence” that callback operators in the campaign “will likely use ransomware to monetize their operation,” they said, “as 2021 BazarCall campaigns would eventually lead to Conti ransomware,” they said.

“This is the first identified callback campaign impersonating cybersecurity entities and has higher potential success given the urgent nature of cyber breaches,” researchers wrote.

Further, they stressed that CrowdStrike would never contact customers in this way, and urged any of their customers receiving such emails to forward phishing emails to the address csirt@crowdstrike.com.

This assurance is key particularly with cybercriminals becoming so adept at social engineering tactics that appear perfectly legitimate to unsuspecting targets of malicious campaigns, noted one security professional.

“One of the most important facets of effective cybersecurity awareness training is educating users beforehand on how they will or will not be contacted, and what information or actions they may be asked to take,” Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at cybersecurity company Cerberus Sentinel, wrote in an email to Threatpost. “It is critical that users understand how they may be contacted by legitimate internal or external departments, and this goes beyond just cybersecurity.”"
Email Phishing,"Novel Phishing Trick Uses Weird Links to Bypass Spam Filters

A novel form of phishing takes advantage of a disparity between how browsers and email inboxes read web domains.

Researchers have identified a never-before-seen method for sneaking malicious links into email inboxes.

The clever trick takes advantage of a key difference in how email inboxes and browsers read URLs, according a Monday report by Perception Point.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

The attacker crafted an unusual link using an “@” symbol in the middle. Ordinary email security filters interpreted it as a comment, but browsers interpreted it as a legitimate web domain. Thus the phishing emails successfully bypassed security, but when targets clicked on the link inside, they were directed to a fake landing page nonetheless.

A Lame Phishing Attempt
On May 2, Perception Point’s incident response (IR) team flagged a hasily-designed phishing email trying to pass itself off as a Microsoft notice. “You have new 5 held messages,” it read, directing the recipient to follow a “Personal Portal” hyperlink.



The link directed to a website masquerading as an Outlook login page. Again the hacker’s design choices were poor, and the domain name for this supposed Outlook page was, in fact, “storageapi.fleek.co,” followed by a long series of random characters.



In theory, if a user had overlooked all of these red flags, and submitted their Microsoft credentials, those credentials would’ve gone to the attacker.

So here’s the mystery: how did such a low-effort phishing attempt make it past email security filters, which are trained to spot much more sophisticated frauds than this?

The key was in the email link.

Some Background on Links
Pause here for a moment, and open up another webpage in your browser.

Type “https://” into your address bar, then any string of characters you want. Next, type an @ symbol, followed by any web domain. For example:

https[://]abc123@www[.]threatpost.com

Depending on what browser you’re using, that text before the @ will either return an error message, or disappear without a trace. Why?

Well, some browsers enable you to automatically send authentication information to the website you want to visit. The syntax is as follows:

http(s)://username[:]password[@]server/resource[.]ext

Browsers that support this feature will interpret the string before the @ sign as login credentials. Browsers that don’t will simply ignore the string and execute whatever follows the @. Either way, the domain following @ is where you’ll be going.

In January, Microsoft removed this feature from Internet Explorer because of how easily hackers can use it to mask malicious websites as legitimate ones. They explained how:

For example, the following URL appears to open http://www[.]wingtiptoys[.]com but actually opens http://example[.]com:

http://www[.]wingtiptoys[.]com@example[.]com

Which brings us to the crux of today’s news…

The Hacker’s Trick

The URL embedded in the phishing emails from our story was:



As we’ve established, browsers will read this as a URL. But email services read the @ symbol in the middle very differently.

“It is common knowledge that an @ sign will be ignored by email security systems when used within the text of an email, and there are many instances of this being used legitimately,” Motti Elloul, vice president of customer success and incident response at Perception Point, told Threatpost via email, “For example, it can be used to refer to user information within the body of the message.” For this reason, the IR team wrote in their report, “most email detection platforms cannot recognize this address as a URL, and instead see it as a comment.”

The @ symbol is a cover: to an email security filter it’s a comment, but underneath it’s a regular old malicious link.

The Impact
Our hacker – unknown but for an IP address 202[.]172.25[.]42, coming from Japan – went after “a wide range of targets, including telecom, web services and financial organizations,” said Elloul. None of their emails managed to trick any targets before they were discovered.

Despite the failure of this particular campaign, Elloul told Threatpost, “the technique has the potential to catch on quickly, because it’s very easy to execute.” As a proof of concept, at least, it proved rather effective.

“In order to identify the technique and avoid the fallout from it slipping past security systems, security teams need to update their detection engines in order to double check the URL structure whenever @ is included.”"
Email Phishing,"Exchange Servers Speared in IcedID Phishing Campaign

The ever-evolving malware shows off new tactics that use email thread hijacking and other obfuscation techniques to provide advanced evasion techniques.

The ever-evolving banking trojan IcedID is back again with a phishing campaign that uses previously compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send emails that appear to come from legitimate accounts. Attackers also are using stealthy new payload-delivery tactics to spread the modular malware.

Researchers from Intezer earlier this month uncovered the campaign, which employs thread hijacking to send malicious messages from stolen Exchange accounts, thus adding an extra level of evasion to the campaign’s malicious intent, wrote researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ryan Robinson in a blog post published Monday.

The actors behind IcedID – as well as other spearphishers – have previously used phishing emails that “reuse previously stolen emails to make the lure more convincing,” researchers wrote. However, this time the threat has evolved in a couple of key ways that make it even more dangerous to targets, which include organizations within energy, healthcare, law and pharmaceutical sectors, researchers noted.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

Not only is the threat actor now using compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from, but the delivery of the malicious payload also has shifted in a way that can execute malware without the user even knowing, researchers said.

“The payload has also moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file,” researchers wrote. “The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user.”

Previously the infection chain most commonly associated with IcedID phishing campaigns has been an email with an attached password-protected ZIP archive that contains a macro-enabled Office document, which executes the IcedID installer.

Breakdown of the Attack Chain
The new campaign starts with a phishing email that includes a message about an important document and includes a password-protected ZIP archive file attached, the password for which is included in the email body.

The email seems extra convincing to users because it uses what’s called “thread hijacking,” in which attackers use a portion of a previous thread from a legitimate email found in the inbox of the stolen account.

“By using this approach, the email appears more legitimate and is transported through the normal channels which can also include security products,” researchers wrote.

The majority of the originating Exchange servers that researchers observed in the campaign appear to be unpatched and publicly exposed, “making the ProxyShell vector a good theory,” they wrote. ProxyShell is a remote-code execution (RCE) bug discovered in Exchange Servers last year that has since been patched but has been throttled by attackers.

Once unzipped, the attached file includes a single “ISO” file with the same file name as the ZIP archive that was created not that long before the email was sent. That ISO file includes two files: a LNK file named “document” and a DLL file named “main,” also prepared relatively recently and potentially used in previous phishing email, researchers said.

When a user double clicks the LNK file, it uses “regsvr32” to execute the DLL file, which allows for proxy execution of malicious code in main.dll for defense evasion, they wrote in the post. The DLL file is a loader for the IcedID payload.

The loader will locate the encrypted payload, which is stored in the resource section of the binary, through the technique API hashing. The resulting hash is then compared with a hardcoded hash, locating the call for FindResourceA, which is dynamically called to fetch the encrypted payload, researchers wrote.

The ultimate step in the attack chain is that the IcedID “Gziploader” payload is decoded and placed in memory and then executed. The GZiploader fingerprints the machine and sends a beacon to the command-and-control (C2) server – located at yourgroceries[.]top. – with information about the infected host, which then can be used for further nefarious activity.

Evolution of a Threat
Researchers at IBM first discovered IcedID back in 2017 as a trojan targeting banks, payment card providers, mobile services providers, payroll, web mail and e-commerce sites.

The malware has evolved over the years and already has a storied history of clever obfuscation. For example, it resurfaced during the COVID-19 campaign with new functionality that uses steganography – the practice of hiding code within images to stealthily infect victims – as well as other enhancements.

The new campaign is evidence of its further evolution and could signify that IcedID is indeed becoming, as many fear, the new Emotet – a modular threat that began as a trojan but steadily evolved into one of the most dangerous malwares ever seen.

“This attack shows how much effort attackers put in all the time to evade detection and why defense in depth is necessary,” observed Saumitra Das, CTO and co-founder at security firm Blue Hexagon, in an email to Threatpost.

This time and effort, in turn, shows a level of sophistication on the part of those behind IcedID in that they have thorough knowledge of contemporary email protections and are continuously adding new tactics as security also grows and evolves, he said.

“Many email security systems use reputation of senders to block malicious email without being able to assess the email itself,” Das noted. “Here, they used compromised Exchange servers to make it through.”

The group’s use of obfuscated file formats to deliver malware, as well as the final payload’s delivery over the network, also demonstrate that the threat actors know how to evade signature and sandboxes, he added.

“These attacks often go much deeper than simply stealing data,” concurred Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost. “The cybercriminals take the time to read through the mailboxes to understand the inter-organization relationships and operating procedures.

“To protect themselves from similar attacks, it’s critical that organizations ensure that they apply security patches promptly and thoroughly in their environment,” he added. However, what is historically true for patching remains true now: that it’s “a task that’s easier said than done,” Clemens acknowledged.

“It really takes a cultural approach to cybersecurity to plan for failures in defenses like patch management,” he said.

A military email address was used to distribute malicious email macros among EU personnel helping Ukrainians.

Cyberattackers used a compromised Ukrainian military email address to phish EU government employees who’ve been involved in managing the logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine, according to a new report.

Ukraine has been at the center of an unprecedented wave of cyberattacks in recent weeks and months, from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns against organizations and citizens to attacks against national infrastructure and more. This time, attackers went after aides in the EU, leveraging breaking news in the Russian invasion of Ukraine to entice targets into opening emails containing Microsoft Excel files laced with malware.

Researchers attributed the phishing attempt to TA445 (aka UNC1151 or Ghostwriter). TA445 has previously been linked with the government of Belarus.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

Attack Coincided with Russia’s Invasion
On Wednesday, Feb. 23, NATO convened an emergency meeting regarding the impending Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The following day – the day Russia invaded Ukraine – researchers detected a suspicious email making the rounds. Its subject: “IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022.” It contained a macros-enabled Microsoft Excel (.xls) spreadsheet titled “list of persons.xlsx” that, when opened, delivered malware called SunSeed.

The email originated from a ukr.net address, which is a Ukrainian military email address. Oddly enough, the researchers were able to trace the address to a publicly available procurement document for a Stihl-brand lawn mower, purchased back in 2016. The order was made by “Військова частина А2622,” a military unit based in Chernihiv, Ukraine. Exactly how the attackers obtained access to a military email address is not clear.

This phishing targeted a very specific group of European government personnel involved in managing the outflux of refugees from Ukraine. Though the targets “possessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities,” the report noted, “there was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe.”

The goal in targeting these specific individuals was “to gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds, supplies, and people within NATO member countries,” according to the report.

Attackers Tied to Belarus, Russia by Extension
The report noted that no “concrete” evidence can “definitively” tie this campaign to a particular threat actor. Still, the researchers noted a bevy of similarities between this phishing campaign and another campaign from July of last year that targeted U.S. cybersecurity and defense companies.

The July campaign “utilized a highly similar macro-laden XLS attachment to deliver MSI packages that install a Lua malware script,” according to Proofpoint researchers. Lua is the programming language in which SunSeed is coded. “Similarly, the campaign utilized a very recent government report as the basis of the social engineering content,” they added.

The file name in that campaign – “list of participants of the briefing.xls.” – bears striking resemblance to the one used in this new campaign. Furthermore, “the Lua script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected victim’s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages.”

These overlaps allowed the researchers to conclude with moderate confidence that the two campaigns were perpetrated by the same threat actor: TA445. According to Mandiant, the group is based in Minsk, connected to the Belarusian military, and conducts its business in the interests of the Belarusian government. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.

The researchers concluded with a disclaimer. On balancing “responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence,” they wrote, “the onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators.”

Ukraine’s Unprecedented Cyber Targeting
This phishing campaign isn’t the worst Ukraine-oriented cyberattack in recent weeks, or even recent days. Still, the researchers noted that “while the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective.”

Thomas Stoesser, of comforte AG, told Threatpost via email that this attack “shows just how ruthless and clever threat actors can be in adapting existing social engineering tactics.”

“The situation underscores two key points that every enterprise should heed,” he added. “One, it’s not enough simply to educate employees sporadically about common social engineering tactics. [Companies] need to put a premium on employees treating every email with healthy skepticism. Two, protect all sensitive enterprise data with more than just perimeter security, even if you feel that the impenetrable vault you’ve stored it all in is foolproof.”

Attackers took advantage of a smart-contract migration to swindle 17 users.

Over the weekend, hackers stole millions of dollars worth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) belonging to 17 members of the OpenSea NFT marketplace.

On Saturday, a small number of OpenSea users noticed their NFTs were missing. (NFTs are digital tokens on the blockchain that represent ownership over virtual assets, such as digital drawings or music.)

“Panic erupted” wrote Molly White, who runs the blog Web3 is Going Great, because “many others feared the same could happen to them.”

Speculation abounded that a glitch might have arisen from OpenSea’s smart contract – i.e., the software that the platform runs on – or perhaps from a widely disseminated token airdrop carried out by a knockoff NFT marketplace called X2Y2.

The real cause was much more interesting.

About an hour and a half after the NFTs went missing, OpenSea tweeted that, in fact, the phenomenon appeared “to be a phishing attack originating outside of OpenSea’s website.”


Hackers, it turned out, had used some clever social engineering to phish unwitting investors.

Bait-and-Switch Contract
On Friday, OpenSea had launched a new smart contract. Quickly, a malicious actor copied and re-sent OpenSea’s email blast notifying users.

Those who opened the copycat email were directed to a copycat webpage. There, they were prompted to sign a seemingly legitimate transaction that, purportedly, would migrate their NFTs from the old to the new contract.

Instead, clicking “Sign” triggered a function called “atomicMatch_.” As Check Point Software described on Sunday, “this kind of request is capable of stealing all victim NFTS in one transaction.”

Engineer Head-Bangers
Unfortunately phishing attacks and social engineering remain some of the hardest security issues to solve as an engineer, noted Matt Bailey, VP of Engineering at Club NFT, via email. That isn’t new to Web3 – a hazy term for blockchain-based, decentralized systems and technology meant to replace our current internet – but “it does come with some new wrinkles,” Bailey said.

“General usability continues to be a challenge and can contribute to confusion. Understanding what it is you are signing digitally as a user is not always obvious,” he explained.

Because blockchain transactions are irreversible, the threat of one wrong click is arguably even greater than in traditional IT attacks.

At first, CEO Devin Finzer reported that 32 OpenSea users had fallen victim to the ruse. That figure turned out to be an overshot. New findings on Monday clarified that the “original count included anyone who had *interacted* with the attacker, rather than those who were victims of the phishing attack.”


In the end, 250 NFTs were stolen from just 17 users.

Even with so few victims, however, the monetary impact of this campaign was extraordinary.

OpenSea is one of the most recognizable names in the NFT – as in, the cryptocurrency/blockchain/metaverse – space. As of January 2022, the company was valued at $13.3 billion. Daily trading activity on OpenSea has tended to fluctuate between $100M-$200M per day, with $3.68 billion worth of NFT transactions occurring in only the past 30 days, according to DappRadar. According to blockchain research firm Chainalysis, the total market for NFTs reached $41 billion in 2021.

The growing value of NFTs helps explain why this particular attacker was able to flip just 17 victims’ assets for around $1.7 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).

Such a high-profile incident “presents the opportunity to improve both personal and marketplace security,” observed Jake Fraser, Head of Business Development for the NFT marketplace Mogul Productions.

Blockchain companies will be encouraged to invest in third-party smart contract auditing and bug bounty programs and will place a greater emphasis on educating investors about risks, he told Threatpost on Monday via Telegram. “When individuals get more educated, it prevents the likelihood of phishing attacks taking place. Most people in the space are still using hot [online] wallets to store their NFTs, so this is why it is crucial that they know how to identify the red flags when a phishing attack is taking place.”

Data from Etherscan indicates that this particular campaign may be over, given that the account trafficking the stolen NFTs had initiated only one transaction in the 30 hours preceding the time this article was written on Monday afternoon ET."

The phishing attacks are spoofing LinkedIn to target ‘Great Resignation’ job hunters, who are also being preyed on by huge data-scraping bot attacks.

Emotionally vulnerable and willing to offer up any information that lands the gig, job seekers are prime targets for social engineering campaigns. And with the “Great Resignation” in full swing, cybercriminals are having an easy time finding their next victim.

Just since Feb. 1, analysts have watched phishing email attacks impersonating LinkedIn surge 232 percent, attempting to trick job seekers into giving up their credentials.

“Current employment trends help to make this attack more convincing,” a new report from Egress said. “‘The Great Resignation’ continues to dominate headlines, and a record number of Americans left their jobs in 2021 for new opportunities. It is likely these phishing attacks aim to capitalize on jobseekers (plus curious individuals) by flattering them into believing their profile is being viewed and their experience is relevant to household brands.”

The emails had subject lines that would be enticing to job hunters hoping to get noticed, like, “Who’s searching for you online,” “You appeared in 4 searches this week” or even “You have 1 new message,” the Egress team said.

The phishing emails themselves were convincing dupes, built in HTML templates with the LinkedIn logo, colors and icons, the report added. The scammers also name-checked well-known companies throughout the bodies of the phishing emails, including American Express and CVS Carepoint, to make the correspondence seem more legitimate, the analysts said.

Even the email’s footer lifted the company’s headquarters’ address and included “unsubscribe” links to add to the email’s authenticity, the analysts pointed out.

“You can also see the LinkedIn display name spoofing, which is designed to hide the webmail accounts used to launch the attacks,” the report said.

Once the victim clicks on the malicious links in the email, they were directed to a site to harvest their LinkedIn logins and passwords.

“While the display name is always LinkedIn and the emails all follow a similar pattern, the phishing attacks are sent from different webmail addresses that have zero correlation with each other,” the analysts added. “Currently, it is unknown whether these attacks are the work of one cybercriminal or a gang operating together.”

021722 09:18 UPDATE: LinkedIn sent the following statement to Threatpost:

“Our internal teams work to take action against those who attempt to harm LinkedIn members through phishing. We encourage members to report suspicious messages and help them learn more about what they can do to protect themselves, including turning on two-step verification. To learn more about how members can identify phishing messages, see our Help Center here.”

Data Scraping Attacks on Job Seekers
Besides using potential job leads to trick targets into coughing up their credentials, Imperva, in a separate report, detailed how it stopped the largest bot attack the company has seen to date, on a global job listing site.

Imperva didn’t specifically name the company, but the company said that it was bombarded with 400 million bot requests over 400,000 unique IP addresses over four days that tried to scrape all its job seekers’ data.

The Imperva team added that these types of web-scraping attacks are common and can result in “lower conversion rates, skewed marketing analytics, decrease in SEO ranking, website latency, and even downtime (usually caused by aggressive scrapers).”

But as Imperva pointed out in its report, data scraping is one of those cybersecurity gray areas. Collecting publicly available information isn’t itself a data breach, but collected in mass quantities, it can be a weapon wielded against users in social-engineering attacks.

Last summer, a massive data-scraping attack against LinkedIn was discovered to have collected at least 1.2 billion user records that were later sold on underground forums. At the time, LinkedIn reiterated that the scraped data was public information, not private information, and didn’t qualify as a breach.

LinkedIn isn’t really at fault here, according to Yehuda Rosen, senior software engineer at nVisium.

“This has little to do with LinkedIn specifically – they’re not doing anything wrong here,” Rosen explained to Threatpost. “It boils down to the fact that LinkedIn has hundreds of millions of members – many of whom are very accustomed to seeing frequent legitimate emails from LinkedIn – and may inevitably click without carefully checking that each and every email is the real deal.”

That leaves it to individual users to be mindful of the information they expose publicly and how it could be used to trick them into clicking on a malicious link.

“While I don’t believe that this will hurt LinkedIn’s brand, this does reiterate the importance of email phishing education,” Ray Kelly, with NTT Application Security, told Threatpost by email. “Given these emails are coming from a legit LinkedIn email address makes it especially difficult to identify the danger. My rule is to never click on email links. Always visit the site directly.”"

Omicron COVID-19 variant anxiety inspires new phishing scam offering fake NHS tests to steal data.

The global pandemic has provided cover for all sorts of phishing scams over the past couple of years, and the rise in alarm over the spread of the latest COVID-19 variant, Omicron, is no exception.

As public health professionals across the globe grapple with what they fear could be an even more dangerous COVID-19 variant than Delta, threat actors have grabbed the opportunity to turn uncertainty into cash.

U.K. consumer watchdog “Which?” has raised the alarm that a new phishing scam, doctored up to look like official communications from the National Health Service (NHS), is targeting people with fraud offers for free PCR tests for the COVID-19 Omicron variant.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization WHO) list Omicron as a “variant of concern” of the COVID-19 virus, and warned this week that it’s spreading rapidly around the world. Public-health officials aren’t sure yet how effective current vaccines and other mitigation strategies will be against the mutation, according to CBS News.

Once again, global pandemic distress has presented an opportunity for scammers.

Omicron Anxiety Fuels Scam
Sent by text, email and even offered over the phone, threat actors are contacting people across the U.K. offering them what they say are new test kits specifically designed to detect the Omicron variant.

“NHS scientists have warned that the new Covid [sic] variant Omicron spreads rapidly, can be transmitted between fully vaccinated people, and makes jabs less effective,” one phishing email discovered by Which? read. “However, as the new covid [sic] variant (Omicron) has quickly become apparent, we have had to make new test kits as the new variant appears dormant in the original tests.”

Besides giving false information, the email is littered with grammatical errors. But, should a victim click on the link at the bottom of the correspondence, it takes the person to a fake NHS page that asks for full name, date of birth, address, phone numbers and email address.

In addition to harvesting personally identifiable information (PII), the site also asks for a £1.24 as a delivery fee and mother’s maiden name, giving the scammers access to the target’s banking information as well.

This, and other pandemic-related phishing campaigns, rely on the victim’s anxiety to cause them overlook obvious signs of fraud.

“Phishing attacks and other scams often exploit emotions to get people to react quickly and without thinking things through,” Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told Threatpost. “This new COVID-19 variant has some significant emotional weight for people who are tired of lockdowns and the continuing impact of the pandemic, making it a powerful tool to get people to click.”

The watchdog has submitted its findings to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), but warned that other similar Omicron bait is likely to surface over the next several weeks — so consumers should be on alert.

COVID-19 Phishing Frenzy
Last year, when COVID-19 vaccines began rolling out, one analysis from Barracuda Networks found between October 2020 and last January, the average number of vaccine-themed spear phishing attacks grew by 26 percent.

By May, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Department of Homeland Security shut down a scam site targeting immigrant communities with vaccine-related phishing scams.

Besides vaccine lures, the pandemic has inspired spear-phishing campaigns offering fake COVID-19 relief checks and even job opportunities for those left unemployed by widespread shutdowns. Even people who held onto their jobs were targeted once they returned to work, with scam emails purporting to offer new office COVID-19 protocols. They instead stole their login credentials.

Users should be cautious about almost any unsolicited communication relating to COVID-19. Anyone who received one of these scam Omicron PCR test emails is advised by Which? to forward it via report websites to the NCSC."

Ransomware Phishing Emails Sneak Through SEGs

The MICROP ransomware spreads via Google Drive and locally stored passwords.

Secure email gateway (SEG) protections aren’t necessarily enough to stop phishing emails from delivering ransomware to employees, especially if the cybercrooks are using legitimate cloud services to host malicious pages.

Researchers are raising the alarm over a phishing email kicking off a Halloween-themed MICROP ransomware offensive, which they observed making its way to a target’s inbox despite its being secured by an SEG.

Infection Routine
The original email purported to need support for a “DWG following Supplies List,” which is supposedly hyperlinked to a Google Drive URL. The URL is actually an infection link, which downloaded an .MHT file.

“.MHT file extensions are commonly used by web browsers as a webpage archive,” Cofense researchers explained. “After opening the file the target is presented with a blurred out and apparently stamped form, but the threat actor is using the .MHT file to reach out to the malware payload.”

That payload comes in the form of a downloaded .RAR file, which in turn contains an .EXE file.

“The executable is a DotNETLoader that uses VBS scripts to drop and run the MIRCOP ransomware in memory,” according to the analysis.

The campaign is not particularly sophisticated, but the use of Google Drive allowed it to get past SEGs.

“Its opening lure is business-themed, making use of a service – such as Google Drive – that enterprises employ for delivering files,” the researchers explained. “The rapid deployment from the MHT payload to final encryption shows that this group is not concerned with being sneaky. Since the delivery of this ransomware is so simple, it is especially worrying that this email found its way into the inbox of an environment using a SEG.”

The recipient of this Halloween MICROP reported the email as suspicious, leading Cofense to discover the potential new threat.

A Gory Theme, Unusual Use of Skype
“The MIRCOP ransomware, also known as Crypt888 ransomware, encrypts users’ files to hold them hostage,” a Cofense analysts reported. “After the payment demand is met, the threat actor promises to provide the decryption method. For this attack, the threat actor gives a set of instructions on the wallpaper.”



The user is also unable to open any applications besides a few web browsers that can give them access to their email address which is used to contact the attacker,” Cofense researchers wrote in a recent posting. “The email address is then used to set up the payment required to gain access to the decrypting tool the threat actor claims will unlock the files and applications.”

They added, “The use of Skype as a medium to negotiate is uncommon, as most organized ransomware gangs have dedicated sites or mobile chat apps.”

Watch Locally Stored Passwords
The other interesting aspect of this campaign is a malicious file observed by the Cofense team, named “PI2.exe.” It steals passwords from web browsers including Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, giving the threat actors both lateral access around the network, as well as an entry point for future attacks.

“Looking up the SHA256 hash of this executable on Virus Total, it can be linked to dozens of malicious executables going back to June of this year,” researchers said.

This “tool” indicates that the shift to working outside the office just further exposes business to these kinds of attacks, according to Miclain Keffeler, an application security consultant with nVisium, which is why local password management as well as reining in cloud permissions is increasingly imperative, he explained to Threatpost.

“Crypt888 seeks horizontal privilege escalation by stealing passwords that users may have saved locally — inevitably to be used in other ways that could wreak havoc on a business,” Keffeler said. “As the cloud continues to grow, these saved passwords become a key attack vector as they can often grant large amounts of access — with little to no security controls.”"
Email Phishing,"Phishing Scam Aims to Hijack TikTok ‘Influencer’ Accounts

Threat actors used malicious emails to target more than 125 people with high-profile TikTok accounts in an attempt to steal info and lock them out.

A recently discovered phishing scam tried to takeover more than 125 high-profile user accounts on TikTok. Researchers said the campaign marks one of the first major attacks on “influencers” found on the TikTok social-media platform.

Researchers at cloud email security provider Abnormal Security detected the scams that attempted to take over people’s accounts by sending emails impersonating TikTok and asking users to verify their log-in information.

The campaign, tracked on Oct. 2 and Nov. 1, was sent to individuals worldwide. Each target had large-volume TikTok accounts “of all kinds and across disparate locales,” according to a Tuesday report authored by Abnormal Security.

“Among the typical talent agencies and brand-consultant firms we would expect to see, this actor sent messages to social media production studios, influencer management firms, and content producers of all types,” Rachelle Chouinard, a threat intelligence analyst at Abnormal Security, wrote in the report.

Impersonation Game
The emails tried to dupe users into sending their log-in information to the threat actors in one of two ways, each of which required further action from the target. In both cases attackers pretended to be contacting users from TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

One of the emails sent in the campaign informed the user that his or her account violated TikTok’s copyright and asked the user to reply to the email to verify the account, threatening to remove the account in 48 hours if action was not taken.

A second email falsely claiming to be sent by “TikTok officials” informed account holders that the account was eligible for a “verified badge” and asked them to reply to the email so the account could be properly verified.

“From well-known digital media channels to individual actors, models, and magicians, the campaign reached out to content creators worldwide,” Chouinard wrote. “Several emails were sent to the wrong company of the same name in the same country, and many of the email addresses used appear to have been lifted directly from social media.”

Connecting with Attackers
Researchers turned the attackers’ tactics back on them, impersonating influencers by responding to the phishing email, which garnered an email response containing shortened link titled “Confirm My Account” that directed researchers to a WhatsApp chat conversation, she explained.

“Within the WhatsApp conversation, we were asked to verify the phone number and email address linked to the targeted TikTok account,” Chouinard wrote.

Next, the threat actor impersonating “TikTok officials” asked researchers to confirm their ownership of the account by providing the six-digit code they’d sent, demonstrating how they bypass multi-factor authentication to take over the account.

Communications with attackers ceased after that because attackers likely checked the TikTok account researchers used, which would show that “our audience engagement was below par,” Chouinard wrote. Abnormal Security tried to find an influencer who would permit use of his or her account for the experiment but did not succeed, she said.

Motive Unclear
The campaign resulted in a number of those targeted having their accounts deleted or taken over and their data stolen, researchers reported. However, beyond this, researchers didn’t see much of a clear motive for the campaign that would benefit attackers, Chouinard wrote.

However, it’s not uncommon for threat actors to target high-profile users of social media accounts—more commonly people who are so-called “influencers” on Instagram and Facebook–to extort money from account owners to get them back, she noted.

“Past targeting of social media accounts on other platforms offers several options,” Chouinard wrote. “Social media accounts have become increasingly valuable in recent years, creating the incentive to ransom them back to the original owners for a hefty fee.”

Instagram users were indeed the target of a threat campaign from Turkish-speaking cybercriminals uncovered in August 2020. Attackers targeted hundreds of celebrities, startup business owners and others with sizeable followings on the platform in an attempt to steal both Instagram and email credentials.

This type of activity has spurred “an underground economy” offering ban-as-a-service, manipulating abuse reporting mechanisms to harass and censor other users, primarily on Instagram, Chouinard added."
Email Phishing,"Tiny Font Size Fools Email Filters in BEC Phishing

The One Font BEC campaign targets Microsoft 365 users and uses sophisticated obfuscation tactics to slip past security protections to harvest credentials.

A new business email compromise (BEC) campaign targeting Microsoft 365 users is using a range of sophisticated obfuscation tactics within phishing emails that can fool natural language processing filters and are undetectable to end users.

Researchers at Avanan, a CheckPoint company, first discovered the campaign – dubbed One Font because of the way it hides text in a one-point font size within messages – in September.

Attackers also are hiding links within the cascading style sheets (CSS) in their phishing emails: another tactic that serves to confuse natural language filters like Microsoft’s Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers said in a report posted online Thursday.


Register now for our LIVE event!

The One Font campaign also includes messages with links coded within the <font> tag, which – in combination with the other obfuscation techniques – also destroy the effectiveness of email filters that depend on natural language for their analysis, according to Jeremy Fuchs, a cybersecurity researcher at Avanan.

“This breaks semantic analysis, which leads many solutions to treat it as a marketing email, as opposed to phishing,” Fuchs wrote. “Natural language filters see random text; human readers see what the attackers want them to see.”

The recent campaign is similar to one Avanan researchers discovered in 2018 called ZeroFont, which used similar tactics to get past Microsoft NLP in its Office 365 security protections. That campaign inserted hidden text with the font size of zero within messages to trip up email scanners that depend on natural language to weed out malicious emails.

Like that campaign, One Font also targets Office 365 organizations and can lead to BEC and ultimately endanger the corporate network if the messages aren’t flagged and users are duped into giving up their credentials, researchers said.

Obfuscation Sophistication
Indeed, since the ZeroFont campaign, cybercriminals have gotten increasingly sophisticated in their tactics to slip past the NLP used in common email filters, researchers said. Other techniques that Avanan researchers have observed include redirect tactics like meta refresh that can disrupt NLP and bypass Microsoft SafeLinks, they said.

Once it makes it to inboxes appearing to be a legitimate message, the One Font campaign uses typical phishing social-engineering tactics to get people’s attention. Attackers present what looks like a password-expiration notice, using urgent messaging to spur a potential victim into clicking on a malicious link.

That link carries them to a phishing page where they appear to be entering their credentials so they can change their passwords. Instead, threat actors are stealing their credentials to use for other cybercriminal activity, researchers said.

In their post, researchers demonstrated how specific phishing emails used a combination of tactics – specifically, links hidden within the CSS and links slipped within the <font> tag and then sized down to zero – that together confound natural language filters.

Because such obfuscation techniques are invisible to the end user, flagging such messages as malicious can be tricky, Fuchs noted. To avoid these messages slipping past filters, researchers recommend that organizations use a multi-tiered security solution that combines advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as static layers like domain and sender reputation, he wrote.

Using a security architecture that relies on more than one factor to block email and requiring corporate users to confirm with an IT department before engaging with any email that asks for a password change also can serve to mitigate attacks, Fuchs wrote.

The kid was busted after abusing Google Ads to lure users to his fake gift card site. 

During the early days of the pandemic, while the rest of the world was stress streaming and working on sourdough starter, an ambitious teen stuck in his bedroom decided to set up a fake “Love2Shop” gift card site to harvest people’s payment information, invest the stolen money in cryptocurrency and become a millionaire.

The intrepid 17-year-old in the U.K. collected just under $9,000 before the real Love2Shop caught on when customers started to complain, according to a local report from Lincolnshire Live. The boy’s name is being withheld because he’s a juvenile.

His age certainly didn’t prohibit the scammer from being allowed to purchase Google ads to help lure people to his phishing scam site, according to prosecutors, ultimately ranking the scam phishing site over the legitimate one.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

In all, law enforcement said they found 12,000 credit card numbers and 197 PayPal accounts on his computer. They added that he had collected more than $440,000 in stolen money.

“He had received through his PayPal accounts between January and March 2020 a total of £323,000,” the case’s prosecutor, Sam Skinner, said, according to Lincolnshire Live. “These sums came into his account and were transferred into cryptocurrency.”

Grift Cash Invested in Crypto
Turns out not only did the teen set up a lucrative criminal enterprise, but he’s also a wicked investor. His cryptocurrency investments were enormously profitable, ultimately climbing to more than $2.5 million.

“The police found a large quantity of cryptocurrency,” Skinner added, “There were 48 Bitcoins and a smaller number of other coins. At the time they were worth £200,000. They are now worth a little over £2 million.”

The teen was sentenced to a year in youth rehabilitation for fraud and money laundering. His Bitcoin was also confiscated.

Cybersecurity Fundamentals
A bored kid being able to pull off a heist of this size is a symptom of the wider cybersecurity community’s lack of fidelity to fundamentals, according to John Bambenek, principal threat hunter with Netenrich.

“Ultimately, 40 years on with Internet-connected technologies and we still can’t resolve two basic problems: How can consumers verify that the websites they visit are legitimate? And, How can financial institutions validate transactions are legitimate?” Bambenek told Threatpost. “We’re failing so profoundly at the very basics that children can literally become millionaire criminals.”

And the blame so often placed on users for falling victims to cybercrime hasn’t helped anyone but the attackers, as pointed out to Threatpost by Archie Agarwal, CEO of ThreatModeler. He added that companies with massive platforms like Google and PayPal have a responsibility to protect their platforms from being abused.

Securing Massive Platforms from Abuse
“With the prevalence of open-source tools that scrape and rebuild replica existing websites in minutes, this type of crime is very hard to prevent,” Agarwal wrote. “And we must not make the mistake of blaming the victims for clicking links on a system built on clicking links. It is the duty of the security community and the large Internet companies such as Google and PayPal, who were used in this scam, to find ways for alarms to trip to protect users as fast as possible.”

Threatpost asked Google directly about the U.K. teen’s ability to use Google’s advertising platform for criminal gain, and a spokesperson provided this response:

“Our goal is to create a safe and trustworthy experience for users. We take matters of ad fraud very seriously and continue to vigorously enforce our policies and be nimble when faced with new threats.”

Google’s current ad policies prohibit brand impersonation, replicating original content and various other forms of misrepresentation scammers use to abuse Google’s platform.

When last March’s Ads Safety Report was released, Google vice president Scott Spencer acknowledged that the pandemic and disinformation campaigns aimed at elections around the world have presented the company with a complicated set of challenges over the past year; but pledged to continue to invest in cybersecurity at scale.

Spencer explained that it’s just smart business: “Preserving trust for advertisers and publishers helps their businesses succeed in the long term,” he wrote. “In the upcoming year, we will continue to invest in policies, our team of experts and enforcement technology to stay ahead of potential threats.”"
Email Phishing,"Credential Spear-Phishing Uses Spoofed Zix Encrypted Email

The spoofed email has targeted close to 75K inboxes, slipping past spam and security controls across Office 365, Google Workspace, Exchange, Cisco ESA and more.

Armorblox researchers have spotted an ongoing credential-phishing attack that spoofs an encrypted Zix email – one coming, weirdly enough, from what looks like a legitimate domain associated with the Baptist religion.

At least, the threat actor is sending the phishing attack from “thefullgospelbaptist[.]com”: a domain that might be a deprecated or old version of a legitimate Baptist domain, fullgospelbaptist[.]org, which is a religious organization established in 1994.

In a Tuesday post, researchers said that, to date, the fake-Zix encrypted email has targeted close to 75,000 inboxes and has slipped past embedded spam and security controls across Office 365, Google Workspace, Exchange, Cisco ESA and others.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

God isn’t sending encrypted Zix messages: If hapless users click on the spoofed email’s link, it will try to download a presumably unholy HTML file onto their system.

The attack is targeting a range of companies across sectors including state and local government, education, financial services, healthcare, and energy, selectively going after a mix of senior executives and cross-departmental employees.

In fact, Armorblox’s research team found that the attacker is cherry-picking targets, being careful to select no more than one employee in any single department, probably to forestall the “Hey, did you get this weird email?” chat among officemates.

The Bogus Zix Email
Zix is a key player in the email encryption market, right up there with Cisco Systems, Trend Micro, Proofpoint, Sophos and Norton LifeLock, et al.

Building on the name recognition alone helps the email to pass a sniff test it should rightfully flunk. But beyond the brand name alone, the email attack also uses a “gamut” of additional techniques to evade traditional security filters and to “pass the eye tests of unsuspecting end users,” Armorblox explained, including social engineering, exploiting a legitimate-looking Baptist domain and replication of existing workflows.

The subject header is “Secure Zix message.” The email body’s header reiterates that title and tells the intended victim that they’ve received a secure Zix message. Click on the “Message” button to check it out, the email instructs.

Armorblox provided screenshots of both a genuine Zix secure message and the spoofed Zix secure message notification. As you can see below, the two interfaces aren’t identical, but they’re close enough to trick unsuspecting users.

Satan Wants Select Employees to Click on ‘Message’
Clicking on the “Message” link in the email will trigger an attempted drive-by download of an HTML file named “securemessage.” Armorblox researchers couldn’t open that file in their virtual machine (VM) instance, since that’s not where the redirect appeared. Fortunately, by the time researchers wrote up the attack, most site blockers were erecting a block page to prevent systems from getting infected.

As far as the threat actor’s preferred prey goes, Armorblox had a few examples: For example, one of the SLED (state and local government and education) businesses that Armorblox counts as customers experienced an attack wherein the targets included the CFO, a director of operations, a director of marketing and a professor.

Another example: The credential phishers went after a wellness company, targeting the senior vice president of finance and operations, the president, and a utility email alias (member.services@company[.]com).

Why such a seemingly random spread? The researchers theorized that the attackers might have deliberately chosen their victims “to be across departments and to contain a good mix of senior leadership and individual contributors.”

As well, the attackers may have gone after people who don’t tend to turn to each other if they receive a suspicious email, Armorblox explained.

Slippery Techniques
Armorblox summed up these techniques that the spoofed Zix email is using to evade traditional email security filters and watchful eyes:

Social engineering: The email title, design, and content aimed to induce a sense of trust and urgency in the victims – a sense of trust because the email claimed to come from a legitimate company (Zix), and a sense of urgency because it claimed the victim was sent a secure message – something they would be eager to view. The context of this attack also leverages the curiosity effect, which is a cognitive bias that refers to our innate desire to resolve uncertainty and know more about something.
It’s easy to see how getting an email that somebody bothered to encrypt could pique recipients’ curiosity. A May 2021 report from Security Advisor found that the curiosity effect – the desire to resolve uncertainty – has shown up as one of the top three cognitive biases to be exploited in phishing attacks, appearing in 17 percent of such attacks.

Brand impersonation: The email has HTML stylings and content disclaimers similar to real emails from Zix. While not a perfect replica of the real thing, it bears enough resemblance to a legitimate email to be dangerous.
Exploiting legitimate domain: The parent domain of the email sender was a deprecated or old version of a legitimate domain – ‘thefullgospelbaptist[.]com’. This helped the email bypass authentication checks.
Armorblox researcher Abhishek Iyer told Threatpost on Monday that using legitimate (if unrelated) domains to send emails “is more about tricking security controls (i.e. bypassing authentication checks) than it is about tricking recipients, especially if the domains are not spoofed to look like the real thing.”

An example that Armorblox came across last year was a Verizon credential phishing campaign where the page was hosted on the website of a Wiccan coven. Another example: an Amazon credential phishing campaign where the email was sent from the domain of Blomma Flicka Flowers, a small floral design company based out of Vermont. The campaign aimed to lift credentials and other personal information under the guise of Amazon package-delivery notices.

“Whether these domains are used to send the email or host the phishing page, the attackers’ intent is to evade security controls based on URL/link protection and get past filters that block known bad domains,” Iyer said via email.

Needless to say, the legitimate Baptist organization had nothing to do with the Zix campaign, he continued. “To host phishing pages on legitimate domains, attackers usually exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or the Content Management Systems (CMS) to host the pages without the website admins knowing about it.”

Replicating existing workflows: The context for the email attack replicates workflows that already exist in our daily work lives (getting encrypted email notifications). When we see emails we’ve already seen before, our brains tend to employ System 1 thinking and take quick action. The email content even had every victim’s first name filled in to increase the feeling of legitimacy and the chances of follow through.
“System 1 thinking” is a reference to Daniel Kahneman’s book, “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” which delves into our brains’ two information processing and decision making systems, System 1 being “the automatic, unconscious, and fast mode of thinking, offering little to no rationale behind its actions.” System 2 thinking is what we need when we look into our inboxes: That’s the “slow, methodical, and analytical mode of thinking, skeptical and rational by default,” Armorblox explained.

“Security awareness training programs require us to operate in the System 2 mode of thinking, encouraging us to be suspicious of emails we receive,” Armorblox co-founder Arjun Sambamoorthy recommended in a post earlier this month.

Phishing Is Getting Harder to Spot
In a recent column for Threatpost’s InfoSec Insider series, Troy Gill, manager of security research at Zix, discussed the most common ways sensitive data is scooped up by nefarious sorts. His thoughts on how easy it is for any of us to fall for increasingly sophisticated phishing attempts such as the Zix spoofed email:

“Everyone wants to believe that they wouldn’t fall victim to typical phishing scams. However, the truth is that these methods of intrusion are getting harder to spot as cybercriminals become more savvy with their tactics. Cybercriminals continue to build on trickier spear-phishing strategies that rely on brand-new techniques and even more deceitful tricks that can catch even the most discerning person unaware.” —Troy Gill, Threatpost InfoSec Insider column.

How to Protect Your Business
Armorblox provided this guidance and recommendations to keep the credential-phishers at bay:

Augment native email security with additional controls
The spoofed Zix email got past the security controls of Office 365, Google Workspace, Exchange, Cisco ESA and others. Armorblox recommended that for better protection coverage against email attacks, be they spear-phishing, business email compromise (BEC) or credential phishing attacks like this one, “organizations should augment built-in email security with layers that take a materially different approach to threat detection.”

The screenshot below shows the spoofed Zix email with a Spam Confidence Level (SCL) score of -1. As Microsoft outlines in its matrix of spam confidence level (SCL) in Exchange Online Protection, a rating of -1 means that the message skipped spam filtering and was delivered, since it was assumed to be “from a safe sender, was sent to a safe recipient, or is from an email source server on the IP Allow List.”

Watch out for social engineering cues
“Since we get so many emails from service providers, our brains have been trained to quickly execute on their requested actions. It’s much easier said than done, but engage with these emails in a rational and methodical manner whenever possible,” researchers recommended. “Subject the email to an eye test that includes inspecting the sender name, sender email address, language within the email, and any logical inconsistencies within the email (e.g. Why is a Zix link leading to an HTML download? Why is the sender email domain from a third-party organization?).”

Follow MFA and password management best practices
“Since all workplace accounts are so closely interlinked, sharing credentials to one of your accounts can prove to be very dangerous as cybercriminals send emails in your name to trick your customers, partners, acquaintances, and family members,” Armorblox said.

Its specific recommendations:

If you haven’t already, implement these hygiene best practices:

Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all possible business and personal accounts.
Don’t use the same password on multiple sites/accounts.
Use a password management software like LastPass or 1password to store your account passwords.
Avoid using passwords that tie into your publicly available information (date of birth, anniversary date, etc.).
Don’t repeat passwords across accounts or use generic passwords such as ‘password123’, ‘YourName123’, etc."

Discovery of BulletProofLink—which provides phishing kits, email templates, hosting and other tools—sheds light on how wannabe cybercriminals can get into the business.

Microsoft uncovered a large-scale, well-organization and sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation. The turnkey platform allows users to customize campaigns and develop their own phishing ploys so they can then use the PhaaS platform to help with phishing kits, email templates and hosting services needed to launch attacks.

Microsoft researchers discovered the operation, marketed by criminals as BulletProofLink, when they found a high volume of newly created and unique subdomains—more than 300,000 in a single run, according to a post published by the Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team.

“This investigation led us down a rabbit hole as we unearthed one of the operations that enabled the campaign,” researchers wrote.
Infosec Insiders Newsletter

With more than 100 available phishing templates that mimic known brands and services—including Microsoft itself–the BulletProofLink operation is responsible for many of the phishing campaigns that impact enterprises today, they said.

Phishing is a common way for cybercriminals to dupe people through socially-engineered emails into giving up their credentials to online accounts that can store sensitive data. Phishers use these emails—which sometimes fool people by impersonating a trusted company, application or institution–to direct people to specially crafted phishing sites so they can enter credentials, thinking they are doing so for a legitimate reason

Phishing is often a gateway drug into other criminal activity; phishers sell credentials obtained through campaigns on the dark web, and they can be used by ransomware gangs as an entry point into networks to deliver ransomware attacks, among other nefarious activity.

Full-Scale Phishing Facilitator
BulletProofLink—also known as BulletProftLink or Anthrax by its operators in various websites, ads and other promotional materials–provides a starting point for people without significant resources to get into the phishing business.

The group has been active since 2018 and maintains multiple sites under aliases. The group leverages services such as YouTube and Vimeo offering instructional videos, advertisements and promotional materials. It is known to hawk their wares on a plethora of underground forums, researchers said.

While previously, criminals who wanted to launch these attacks had to build phishing emails and brand-impersonating websites on their own, “the phishing landscape has evolved its own service-based economy,” researchers said. Now attackers can just purchase all the resources and other infrastructure they need to launch phishing attacks without investing a lot of time or effort, researchers said.

There are two key offerings that are available to criminals who want to get into the phishing business: phish kits and phishing-as-a-service.

The first are packaged files sold on a one-time basis that come with ready-to-use email phishing templates designed to evade detection and are often accompanied by a portal with which to access them, researchers explained. The kits—an example of which is the MIRCBOOT phish kit–allow people to set up the websites and purchase the domain names they need to launch phishing campaigns.

The second offering is similar to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which also is a popular way cybercriminals can get into the game without making their own significant investment, researchers said.

PhaaS—the bread and butter of BulletProofLink’s operation–follows the software-as-a-service model, they said. Attackers pay an operator to develop turnkey phishing campaigns that include everything from false sign-in page development to website hosting to credential parsing and redistribution.

Diving Deeper into PhaaS
Researchers took a deeper dive into BulletProofLink’s PhaaS operation to uncover how the group has created a flourishing network of phishers.

Like any service provider, the group explains on an “About Us” page on its site the services it provides, including the sale of a “unique scam page” as well as a monthly hosted subscription service to set up a customer’s phishing operation. In fact, the group hosts multiple sites to serve its customers, including an online store where customers can register, sign in and advertise their hosted service for monthly subscriptions.

The monthly service costs as much as $800, while other services cost about $50 dollars for a one-time hosting link, researchers found, with Bitcoin being a common payment method on the BulletProofLink site. The organization even uses the typical service-provider tactic of offering a 10 percent welcome discount on customers’ orders when they subscribe to its newsletter.

An interesting point about the PhaaS working model BulletProofLink uses is that it follows the RaaS model’s method of double extortion—or in this case, “double theft,” as researchers describe.

In ransomware, this method generally involves attackers exfiltrating and posting data publicly in addition to encrypting them on compromised devices to put pressure on organizations to pay the ransom, they noted.

A similar workflow also is present in the economy of stolen credentials in BulletProofLink’s PhaaS model, researchers wrote. The group includes a secondary location in its phishing kit for credentials to be sent once acquired, they observed.

“In cases where the attackers using the service received credentials and logs at the end of a week instead of conducting campaigns themselves, the PhaaS operator maintained control of all credentials they resell,” researchers wrote.

In both RaaS and PhaaS, then, the operators supplying resources to facilitate attacks maximize monetization by assuring stolen data, access, and credentials are put to use in as many ways as possible. This also ensures that stolen credentials are likely to end up in the undergound economy, researchers observed."

Threat actors dangled the lure of receiving funds from the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and created new domains mimicking the real federal site.

Threat actors impersonated the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) in a two-day phishing campaign that used a combination of tactics – including creating new domains that mimic federal sites so as to appear to be legitimate – to evade security detections.

Between Aug. 16-18, researchers at e-mail security provider INKY detected 41 phishing emails dangling the lure of bidding for projects benefitting from a $1 trillion infrastructure package recently passed by Congress, according to a report written by INKY’s Roger Kay, vice president of security strategy, that was published on Wednesday.

The campaign – which targeted companies in industries such as engineering, energy and architecture that likely would work with the USDOT – sends potential victims an initial email in which they’re told that the USDOT is inviting them to submit a bid for a department project by clicking a big blue button with the words “Click Here to Bid.”

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

The emails themselves are launched from a domain, transportationgov[.]net, that was registered by Amazon on Aug. 16, Kay said. The date of its creation – revealed by WHOIS – seems to signal that the site was set up specifically for the phishing campaign.

To anyone familiar with government sites, the domain would appear suspicious given that government sites typically have a .gov suffix. However, “to someone reading through quickly, the domain name might seem at least somewhere in the ballpark of reality,” Kay observed.

Fooling Targets
If people take the bait and click, they are led to a site, transportation.gov.bidprocure.secure.akjackpot[.]com, “with reassuring-sounding subdomains like ‘transportation,’ ‘gov,’ and ‘secure,'” Kay wrote. However, the base domain of the site, akjackpot[.]com, was actually registered in 2019 and “hosts what may or may not be an online casino that appears to cater to Malaysians,” he wrote.

“Either the site was hijacked, or the site owners are themselves the phishers who used it to impersonate the USDOT,” Kay noted.

Once on the fake bidding site, targets are then instructed to click on a “Bid” button and sign in with their email provider to connect to “the network.” It also instructed them to contact a fictitious person at another fake domain – specifically, mike.reynolds@transportationgov[.]us – with any questions.

Once victims closed the instructions, they were directed to an identical copy of the real USDOT website that the attackers created by copying HTML and CSS from the government’s site onto their phishing site.

In a twist, threat actors also copied and pasted in a real warning about how to verify actual U.S. government sites, which could alert savvy victims that they were being scammed by realizing that the phishing site domain ended in .com rather than .gov or .mil, Kay noted.

Once on the imposter USDOT site, targets are invited to click a red “Click Here to Bid” button that brings up a credential-harvesting form with a Microsoft logo and instructions to “Login with your email provider.” A first attempt to enter credentials is met with a ReCAPTCHA challenge – often used by legitimate sites as an extra security device. However, attackers already captured credentials by this point, Kay noted.

If targets make a second attempt to enter credentials, a fake error message appears, after which they are directed to the real USDOT website – “an elegant but perhaps unnecessary flourish that phishers often execute as the final step of their sequence,” Kay wrote.

Evading Detection
Though attackers didn’t use any particular new phishing tricks in their campaign, it was the combination of tactics in a new pattern that allowed them to get the emails through secure email gateways, Kay said.

“By creating a new domain, exploiting current events, impersonating a known brand, and launching a credential-harvesting operation, the phishers came up with an attack just different enough from known strikes to evade standard detection methods,” he wrote.

Using newly created domains in particular allowed the phishing mails to slip through standard email authentication, i.e., SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, he observed.

“Since they were brand new, the domains represented zero-day vulnerabilities; they had never been seen before and did not appear in threat intelligence feeds commonly referenced by legacy anti-phishing tools,” Kay wrote. “Without a blemish, these sites did not look malicious.”"

CAPTCHA-protected malicious URLs are snowballing lately, researchers said.

Cyberattackers are using Google’s reCAPTCHA (aka the “I am not a robot” function) and fake CAPTCHA-like services to obscure various phishing and other campaigns, according to researchers. There are signs however that those evasion efforts may be losing their efficacy.

CAPTCHAs are familiar to most internet users as the challenges that are used to confirm that they’re human. The Turing test-ish puzzles usually involve clicking all photos in a grid that contain a certain object, or typing in a word presented as blurred or distorted text.

The idea is to weed out bots on eCommerce and online account sites – and they serve the same purpose for crooks.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

“Hiding phishing content behind CAPTCHAs prevents security crawlers from detecting malicious content and adds a legitimate look to phishing login pages,” according to a Friday writeup from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42.

Though it’s far from new, it’s an increasingly popular technique: Just in the last month, the firm found 7,572 unique malicious URLs over 4,088 pay-level domains employing the obfuscation method. That’s an average of 529 new CAPTCHA-protected malicious URLs per day.

Beyond Phishing: New Categories of Malicious URLs
Besides the endless litany of phishing campaigns, scam campaigns and malicious gateways using CAPTCHA evasion are on the rise, according to Unit 42.

“Survey and lottery scams are some of the most common grayware pages,” according to the posting. “In exchange for a fake payment or chance at winning the lottery, the user is lured into disclosing sensitive information, including address, date of birth, banking information, annual income, etc.”

Often, these pages show CAPTCHA challenges only if they suspect automation based on IP and browser versions, researchers said – so as to make it as easy as possible to sucker visitors.

Another growing category is malware delivery pages abusing legitimate CAPTCHA services.

“For example, the URL hxxps://davidemoscato[.]com serves a malicious JAR file that is hidden from security scanners by protecting the page with a CAPTCHA challenge,” researchers noted.

How to Find CAPTCHA-Protected Malicious Sites
The good news is that Unit 42 researchers said that it’s possible to detect phishing pages through the association of CAPTCHA keys.

The page housing the CAPTCHA will have sub-requests that can be parsed in the HTML, which reveal the reCAPTCHA API key used in the URL parameters, researchers said. Such identifiers can be parsed out and searched for on other pages.

“We see many malicious campaigns reuse CAPTCHA service keys, either to simplify their malware infrastructure or to avoid being blocked by the legitimate reCAPTCHA provider for creating too many CAPTCHA accounts and keys,” they explained.

For example, in one case a webpage targeting Microsoft credentials using the same key as a separate URL used for Apple ID phishing, according to the report.

“Mass phishing and grayware campaigns have become more sophisticated, using evasion techniques to escape detection by automated security crawlers,” researchers concluded. “Fortunately, when malicious actors use infrastructure, services or tools across their ecosystem of malicious websites, we have a chance to leverage these indicators against them. CAPTCHA identifiers are one great example of such detection by association.”"

The Pakistan-linked threat group’s campaign uses compromised WordPress sites to deliver the Warzone RAT to manufacturing companies in Taiwan and South Korea.

Threat actors are using compromised WordPress websites to target manufacturers across Asia with a new spear-phishing campaign that delivers the Warzone RAT, a commodity infostealer available widely for purchase on criminal forums, researchers have found.

The threat group Aggah, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan and first identified in March 2019, is delivering the RAT in a campaign aimed at spreading malware to manufacturing companies in Taiwan and South Korea, according to new research from threat detection and response security firm Anomali.

The campaign, which began in early July, uses spoofed email addresses appearing to originate with legitimate customers of the manufacturers, signaling that it was the work of Aggah, researchers noted.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter
“Spoofed business-to-business (B2B) email addresses against the targeted industry is activity consistent with Aggah,” Tara Gould and Rory Gould from Anomali Threat Research wrote in a report on the campaign published Thursday.

Researchers from Palo Alto Network’s Unit 42 first discovered Aggah in March 2019 in a campaign targeting entities in the United Arab Emirates that later was identified as a global phishing campaign designed to deliver RevengeRAT, researchers said.

The group, which typically aims to steal data from targets, was first thought to be associated with Gorgon Group: a Pakistani group known for targeting Western governments. This association has not been proven, but researchers tend to agree that the Urdu-speaking group originated in Pakistan, according to Anomali.

Among the targets of Aggah’s latest campaign were Fon-star International Technology, a Taiwan-based manufacturing company; FomoTech, a Taiwanese engineering company; and Hyundai Electric, a Korean power company.

Threat actors often target global manufacturers and other suppliers not only to target them, but also as a way to infiltrate some of their more high-profile customers. An example of this was seen in April when the now-defunct REvil gang successfully deployed ransomware against Quanta, a Taiwanese supplier of Apple Computer, just ahead of a big Apple product launch event.

REvil stole files from Quanta that included blueprints for some of Apple’s new products. The operators threatened to release more and to spill the beans on new products in order to pressure the company to pay up ahead of Apple’s Spring Loaded event.

Exploiting Compromised WordPress Sites
The latest Aggah spear-phishing campaign begins with a custom email masquerading as “FoodHub.co.uk,” an online food delivery service based in the United Kingdom, researchers said.

The email body includes order and shipping information as well as an attached PowerPoint file named “Purchase order 4500061977,pdf.ppam” that contains obfuscated macros that use mshta.exe to execute JavaScript from a known compromised website, mail.hoteloscar.in/images/5[.]html, researchers explained.

“Hoteloscar.in is the legitimate website for a hotel in India that has been compromised to host malicious scripts,” they said. “Throughout this campaign, we observed legitimate websites being used to host the malicious scripts, most of which appeared to be WordPress sites, indicating the group may have exploited a WordPress vulnerability.”

The JavaScript uses anti-debugging techniques such as setInterval to detect the use of a debugger based on the execution time, researchers noted. This sends setInterval into an infinite loop if a debugger is detected. After the debugging checks, the script returned http://dlsc.af/wp-admin/buy/5[.]html, another compromised website for a food distributor based in Afghanistan.

Eventually, the Javascript uses PowerShell to load hex-encoded payloads, with the ultimate payload being the Warzone RAT, a C++-based malware available for purchase on the dark web, researchers said.

“Warzone is a commodity malware, with cracked versions hosted on GitHub,” they wrote. “The RAT reuses code from the Ave Maria stealer.” Capabilities of the Warzone RAT include privilege escalation, keylogging; remote shell, downloading and executing files, file manager, and persistence on the network, researchers noted.

“To bypass User Account Control (UAC), the Windows Defender path was added to a PowerShell command to exclude it,” they explained. “Privilege escalation in Warzone was carried out using sdclt.exe, a Windows backup utility in Windows 10.”

The Anomali team noted a number of tactics used in the campaign that are evidence of Aggah’s handiwork. These include the use of malicious documents and malicious PowerPoint files containing macros; obfuscated payloads in a PowerShell file, typically hex-encoded; use of scripts embedded in websites; themes of order and payment information; and the aforementioned use of spoofed B2B email addresses within the target industry."
Email Phishing,"Phishing Campaign Dangles SharePoint File-Shares

Attackers spoof sender addresses to appear legitimate in a crafty campaign that can slip past numerous detections, Microsoft researchers have discovered.

Attackers are using spoofed sender addresses and Microsoft SharePoint lures in a new phishing campaign that is “sneakier than usual” and can slip through the usual security protections in its aim to fool people into giving up their credentials, Microsoft researchers discovered.

Microsoft Security Intelligence researchers discovered the campaign targeting organizations that use Microsoft Office 365 by using the file-sharing aspect of SharePoint, they revealed in a tweet on Tuesday.

The campaign spoofs display sender addresses that contain the target usernames and domains, as well as display names “that mimic legitimate services to try and slip through email filters,” researchers said.



Attackers send emails that “use a Sharepoint lure in the display name as well as the message,” researchers said. “This campaign is active with various lure themes,” they tweeted.

The email alerts a recipient to a file-share request from someone who appears to be a colleague that they may have missed and includes a link to a phishing page. To appear authentic, the file is said to contain some type of legitimate business content, such as staff reports, bonuses or price books, researchers noted.

If a user takes the bait, he or she is eventually directed to a phishing page that requires them to sign into Office 365 with their legitimate credentials, Microsoft said.

Given its widespread use among many enterprise and business customers, the SharePoint collaboration platform is a popular target for threat actors.

In particular, its file-sharing capability, combined with spoofing, is a particularly effective way to trick victims into revealing credentials, observed Dora Tudor, a cyber security enthusiast with Heimdal Security.

“When it comes to email spoofing you might think that if the received email came from a trusted entity you can rely on it to be safe but, unfortunately, any links existing in the email may end up infecting you with malware,” she noted in a blog post Tuesday.

Suspicious Signs
Despite the overall craftiness of this latest campaign, there are some telltale signs that something is amiss, according to Microsoft.

For one, the original sender addresses, which use variations of the word “referral,” also use various top-level domains, including the domain com[.]com, which is popularly used by phishing campaigns for spoofing and typosquatting, they noted on Twitter.

Other clues to the malicious intent of the campaign are found in its use of URLs that lead potential victims to the phishing page for entering their credentials, according to researchers.

Attackers use two URLs with malformed HTTP headers, they said. The primary phishing URL is a Google storage resource that directs to an AppSpot domain requiring the user to sign in “before finally serving another Google User Content domain with an Office 365 phishing page,” researchers said.

The second URL used in the campaign is found within the notification settings. This one leads to a compromised SharePoint site “that the attackers use to add legitimacy to the attack,” according to Microsoft.

Both URLs require potential victims to sign in to move on to the final page, “bypassing many sandboxes” on the way, researchers said.

Researchers provided a query string on GitHub that can be run through Microsoft 365 Defender to flag any emails from the campaign that may have slipped past other gateways, they said."

Mass email distribution service compromise mirrors earlier Nobelium attacks.

Customers who signed up for emails from fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill were recently faced with bigger challenges than queso versus sour cream. A breach of the restaurant’s email marketing service last month lead to customers being served phishing lures and malicious links that redirected to credential harvesting sites.

Researchers at Inky reported that Chipotle’s email vendor Mailgun was breached, allowing threat actors to commandeer the company’s email marketing efforts.

Mailgun has not responded to Threatpost’s request for comment.



The Inky report, posted Friday, found 121 phishing emails sent from the compromised Chipotle Mailgun account sent between July 13 and July 16. Those attacks included two vishing attacks (using malicious voicemail message attachments), 14 impersonated USAA bank to harvest financial data and the remaining 105 emails attempted to redirect users to a spoofed Microsoft site that attempted to steal credentials.

TTPs Eerily Similar to Nobelium
The attacks leveraging Chipotle’s breached Mailgun account are similar to Nobelium’s attack on email marketing service in May 2021. That’s when the group breached Constant Contact‘s systems and took over the account of USAID, an international development agency.

“Inky has no evidence to suggest the same actors are involved in these attacks, it appears to be a case of copying a successful attack vector used by Nobelium,” the report said. “Inky continues to investigate these attacks.”

Nobelium has been credited with the SolarWinds attack on the U.S. government.

By late June Nobelium was reported by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center to be behind brute force and password-spray attacks on Microsoft corporate networks as part of ongoing efforts to gain a foothold in U.S. tech and government agencies.

In fact, 45 percent of all phishing attacks in 2020 were aimed at swiping Microsoft credentials, according to a report released early this year by Cofense.

Microsoft continues to be a prime target for phishing attacks because the credentials are highly valuable, Inky explained.

“Almost everyone has a Microsoft account, and logins there can lead to all kinds of interesting data, including other logins, trade secrets, financial details, and other intelligence,” Inky said. “Thus, it is not surprising that INKY identified 105 phishing emails during that three-day stretch all of which had mail.company[.]com links that redirected the recipient to a malicious Microsoft credential-harvesting site. ”"

Employee email takeover exposed personal, medical data of students, employees and patients.

Authorities at the University of California San Diego Health reported a phishing attack led to a major breach of its network, which allowed an adversary to gain access to sensitive patient, student and employee data.

A Wednesday notice from UCSD Health explains the attack occurred between Dec. 2, 2020 and April 8, 2021 and exposed personal information including full names, addresses, date of birth, email, social security number and the date and cost of medical services.

UCSD Health said the matter was referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
“This process of analyzing the data in the email accounts is ongoing,” the notice said. “UC San Diego Health is moving as quickly as possible while taking the care and time to deliver accurate information about which data was impacted. At this time, we are aware that these email accounts contained personal information associated with a subset of our patient, student, and employee community. This review will be complete in September.”

Dangers of Stolen Data
Post investigation, UCSD Health said it will contact individuals whose personal data was exposed and offer them a year of free identity theft protection services. However, experts point out, the potential risks associated with this type of data loss could impact victims for years.

“Fraudsters can leverage the medical records, lab results, Social Security numbers and government identification numbers to impersonate legitimate patients and commit insurance fraud, seek covered medical care and refill unauthorized prescriptions,” Robert Prigge, CEO of Jumio said. “It’s also possible the exposed information is already circulating on the dark web – where it can command a high value since there’s more personal information in health records than any other electronic database.”

James Carder CSO at LogRhythm added the data could be used in threats far more sinister than identity theft.

“They could also face extortion-based attacks threatening to disclose sensitive medical diagnosis or images if payments are not made,” Carder said. “Additionally, it is conceivable that the medical state, diagnosis or prescription information for high profile patients could be of interest to nation states, terrorist groups, or other threat actors looking to do physical harm.”

Healthcare Diagnosis: Weak Security
Still, despite the rising number of attacks against the health care sector throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, medical cybersecurity hasn’t kept apace, said Anurag Kahol, CTO and Cofounder of Bitglass.

Kahol points out between 2019 and 2020 the number of healthcare breaches spiked by 55.1 percent.

“Due to the massive amounts of personal health information (PHI) healthcare institutions store in their systems, the sector as a whole must take a more vigilant approach to security,” Kahol said. “As such, these organizations must leverage a Zero Trust framework to ensure all their resources and data are granularly secure. Additionally, deploying multi-faceted cybersecurity platforms that include data loss prevention (DLP), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) can provide them with full visibility and control over their entire network.”

Regardless of the approach, it’s evident healthcare organizations need better cybersecurity than basic firewall and employee awareness training. A recent Cloudian report found 65 percent of organizations that fell victim to phishing attacks had previously conducted employee cybersecurity training.

Alicia Townsend, technology evangelist, OneLogin pointed out that UCSD Health, in its public breach notification statement, suggested that even basic user training was lacking.

“UC San Diego Health has stated that they have taken steps to enhance their security processes and procedures,” Townsend said.  “But even they admit that they need the ‘community to remain alert to threats.’ We have stated it before, and it needs to be stated again: healthcare institutions must implement security training for all of their users. Everyone needs to be educated on how to spot phishing attempts, how to keep their passwords secure, the importance of using additional authentication factors, and what to do in case they suspect an attack.”"

The unnamed suspect allegedly helped to develop carding and phishing kits with the aim of stealing customers’ bank-card data.

A Moroccan man suspected of being “Dr HeX” – the prolific threat actor behind a nine-year cyber-blitz on thousands of victims through phishing, website defacing, malware development, fraud and carding – has been arrested.

Interpol announced the bust – which took place in Morocco in May – on Tuesday, describing it as the result of a joint two-year probe dubbed Operation Lyrebird that saw Interpol working closely with the Moroccan police and security firm Group-IB.

The unnamed suspect allegedly helped to develop carding and phishing kits to sell on criminal online forums. One example of a carding site is Joker’s Stash, which was taken down in December. It was a popular cybercriminal destination that specialized in trading in payment-card data, offering millions of stolen credit and debit cards to buyers.



As described in Interpol’s announcement, the buyers of Dr HeX’s carding and phishing kits used them to masquerade as online-banking facilities, allowing the suspect and others “to steal sensitive information and defraud trusting individuals for financial gain, with the losses of individuals and companies published online in order to advertise these malicious services.”

We saw one such example of how the carding economy works in October, when Dallas-based smoked-meat franchise Dickey’s Barbecue Pit saw 3 million customer payment cards turn up on the site. Anyone purchasing the information could create cloned cards to physically use at ATMs or at in-store machines that aren’t chip-enabled; or, they can simply use the information to buy things online.

According to a writeup from Group-IB, the suspect was allegedly involved in attacks on 134 websites over the course of nine years, from 2009-2018, leaving his signature “Dr HeX” nickname on the attacked web pages. Dr HeX was just one of the nicknames the suspect allegedly used, but that’s the one that the security firm chose to dub the threat actor whom they tracked.

Squeezing an Identity Out of a Phishing Kit
The starting point for Group-IB researchers’ quest to track down and to unmask Dr HeX was the extraction of a phishing kit, which is a tool used to create phishing web pages. That phishing kit was being used to exploit the brand of a large French bank, according to their writeup.

The phishing kit used a typical setup, they described: It included “the creation of a spoofed website of a targeted company, the mass distribution of emails impersonating it and asking users to enter login information on the spoofed site. The credentials left by unsuspecting victims on the fake page were then redirected to the perpetrator’s email.”

Almost all of the scripts contained in the phishing kit were signed with the signature of their creator, Dr HeX, and had a contact email address.

Dr HeX liked that nickname quite a bit: Group-IB researchers found that the alleged attacker’s YouTube channel was signed under that same name. In one of the YouTube videos on his channel, the attacker also left a link leading to an Arabic crowdfunding platform. That gave Group-IB researchers another hook up to the alleged cybercriminal.

The name was also used to register “at least” two domains that were created with the email found in the phishing kit, Group-IB said.

Based on the email address from the phishing kit, researchers identified other elements of the threat actor’s malicious infrastructure; five email addresses were associated with the suspect; a total of six nicknames; and then there were his accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Skype and YouTube.

Between 2009 and 2018, analysts found that Dr HeX defaced over 130 web pages. They also discovered the cybercriminal’s posts “on several popular underground platforms intended for malware trading that indicate the latter’s involvement in malware development,” according to Group-IB. Analysts also found evidence that might link Dr HeX to attacks on “several huge French corporations” with the aim of “stealing customer’s bank-card data.”

Group-IB’s post quoted Stephen Kavanagh, Interpol executive director of police services, who called Operation Lyrebird “a significant success against a suspect who is accused of targeting unsuspecting individuals and companies across multiple regions for years.”

“The case highlights the threat posed by cybercrime worldwide,” Kavanagh continued. “The arrest of this suspect is down to outstanding international investigative work and new ways of collaboration, both with Moroccan police and our vital private sector partners such as Group-IB.”"
Email Phishing,"Threat Actors Use Google Docs to Host Phishing Attacks

Exploit in the widely used document service leveraged to send malicious links that appear legitimate but actually steal victims credentials.

Threat actors are exploiting Google Docs by hosting their attacks within the web-based document service in a new phishing campaign that delivers malicious links aimed at stealing victims’ credentials.

Researchers at email and collaboration security firm Avanan discovered the campaign, which is the first time they said they’ve seen attackers use this type of exploit in Google’s hosted document service, according to a report published Thursday by Jeremy Fuchs, marketing content manager for Avanan.



By hosting attacks in this way, attackers can bypass link scanners and evade detection from common security protections that aim to verify that links sent via email are legitimate. Previously, attackers have used the attack vector in smaller services such as MailGun, FlipSnack, and Movable Ink, according to Avanan.

Attack Vector
The attack begins with an email that includes a message that could be relevant to business users who commonly use Google Docs within their corporate environment. In the example shown in the report, the message claims the link contains a set of “new rules for June 25.”

If a user clicks on the link, the page appears familiar to anyone using Google Docs to share documents outside the organization, Fuchs said.

“This, however, isn’t that page,” he wrote. “It’s a custom HTML page made to look like that familiar Google Docs share page.”

Once redirected, potential victims are asked to “click here” to download the document. If a user clicks, the page redirects to the actual malicious phishing website, which steals the victim’s credentials using another web page made to look like the Google Login portal but which is actually hosted from a URL clearly not affiliated with the tech giant.

Attack Hosted by Google
The trick to creating the attack vector is that the heavy lifting of the campaign is done by Google Docs, making it “quite simple to execute,” Fuchs explained.

First an attacker would write a web page that resembles a Google Docs sharing page, and then upload that HTML file to Google Drive. Once the file is scanned, Google renders the HTML into a preview page that looks very much like a typical Google Docs page.

An attacker then can right-click on the uploaded file and open it in Google Docs, which is where the simple yet integral aspect of the attack takes place, Fuchs wrote.

“This is the clever bit because if you simply click ‘Get link’ you would only see the source code of the file, not the rendered version,” he wrote. However, by manipulating Google Docs, attackers are able to successfully render the malicious page rather than deliver a page with just source code to a potential victim, which would not be effective.

Final Deployment
Researchers must take one more step to have the file render in a way that a victim will recognize by selecting “Publish to the Web” from the Google Docs “File” dropdown menu.

Then by hitting “Embed” and “Publish,” Google will provide with embed tags that are meant to be used on its own forums to render custom content but which the attacker can use—minus the iframe tags—to save the malicious link intended to be sent via the phishing campaign.

“This link will now render the full HTML file as intended by the attacker and it will also contain the redirect hyperlink to the actual malicious website,” Fuchs explained.

Avanan researchers also spotted the same attack method being used by threat actors to spoof a DocuSign phishing email, he added. In this case, the “View Document” button was a published Google Docs link that actually was a fake DocuSign login page that would transmit the entered password to an attacker-controlled server via a “Log In” button, Fuchs wrote."

Socially engineered BEC attacks using X-rated material spike 974 percent.

Attackers have amped up their use of X-rated phishing lures in business email compromise (BEC) attacks. A new report found a stunning 974-percent spike in social-engineering scams involving suggestive materials, usually aimed at male-sounding names within a company.

The Threat Intelligence team with GreatHorn made the discovery and explained it’s not simply libido driving users to click on these suggestive scams. Instead, these emails popping up on people’s screens at work are intended to shock the user, opening the door for them to make a reckless decision to click. It’s a tactic GreatHorn called “dynamite phishing.”

“It doesn’t always involve explicit material, but the goal is to put the user off balance, frightened – any excited emotional state – to decrease the brain’s ability to make rational decisions,” according to the report.

Breach, Exfiltrate, Blackmail, Repeat
GreatHorn observed the malicious URLs largely do one or more of the same three things: Download malware; send users to a bogus dating site to trick victims into entering payment data; or track users for a follow-up attack, which the report said is likely to involve blackmail. Scammers use a tactic called email pass-through to track their victims.

“The same technology enables legitimate email senders to auto-populate an unsubscribe field with a user email address,” the report said. “Once a user clicks on a link in the email, their email address is automatically passed to the linked site. In these attacks, the cybercriminal leverages the information they gleaned in order to set up a second stage.”

GreatHorn shared an example of the type of X-rated phishing lure, which includes a your-place-or-mine proposition.

The link, the researchers explained would take the user to a photo site, then to a scam dating site, which in this case is at hungrygrizzly.com.


Source: GreatHorn.

“User data gleaned in this way will be transmitted to cybercriminals, who will use it for various malicious purposes, such as money withdrawal, blackmailing or committing further frauds,” GreatHorn added.

Besides being personally embarrassing, these phishing attacks are becoming increasingly dangerous to organizations.

‘Astounding’ Phishing Attacks
To demonstrate just how effective and insidious phishing lures have become, Agari Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID) put 8,000 account credentials under their control on phishing sites just to watch and see what would happen next.

The report called what happened next “astounding.”

A quarter of the account credentials were automatically tested as soon as they were posted.

Additionally, they found three families of attacks were responsible for 85 percent of attacks, demonstrating it that was a small number of threat actors, or versions of phishing code, launching wide-scale campaigns.

Nearly all (92 percent) of the compromised accounts were manually breached by an attacker. About 20 percent (one in five) were accessed within the first hour, and 91 percent were accessed within a week of compromise, the firm found.

“And while a majority of compromised accounts were only accessed one time by actors, we observed a number of examples where a cybercriminal maintained persistent and continuous access to a compromised account,” the ACID team explained.

And worse, as these attackers gain access to an increasing number of accounts, those are then used to launch additional attacks.

“We saw scammers create forwarding rules; pivot to other applications, including Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft Teams; attempt to send outgoing phishing emails, sometimes by the thousands; and use the accounts to set up additional BEC infrastructure,” they warned.

Phishing As Biggest Security Threat
Phishing is one of the biggest cybersecurity challenges any organization faces, Hank Schless from Lookout told Threatpost.

“Phishing attacks can be used as the catalyst for almost any cyberattack,” he explained. “In the past year, we’ve seen countless ransomware attacks and data leaks that started with an individual’s login credentials being compromised.”

Schless added the risks are only compounded on mobile devices, where users are toggling back and forth between communications streams, apps and more.

Netenrich’s Sean Cordero said it time for organizations to completely rethink their IT operations and risk-management strategies to effectively cope with phishing.

“They need to understand the scope of the attackable surface,” he explained. “An organization cannot protect assets and connections to their environment if they are not aware of the amount of exposure they are facing. Unfortunately, the attackers who are well organized and funded have the time and resources to identify the weaknesses.”"
Spear phishing,"DoJ Charges Rhode Island Woman in Phishing Scheme Against Politicians

Diana Lebeau allegedly tried to trick candidates for public office and related individuals into giving up account credentials by impersonating trusted associates and the Microsoft security team.

The Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged a woman in Rhode Island in a phishing campaign against candidates for political office and related associates that impersonated various individuals–including campaign workers and the Microsoft security team—in an attempt to trick victims into providing account credentials.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts has charged Diana Lebeau, 21, of Cranston, R.I.,  with “attempted unauthorized access to a protected computer,” according to a press release from the DoJ.

The charge relates to a phishing campaign Lebeau allegedly mounted beginning in January 2020 against about 22 campaign staffers for an unnamed candidate for political office, as well as another political candidate—also not identified–and related associates, according to the DoJ. Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Kosto is prosecuting the case.
The campaign came in two phases with various targets, with Lebeau allegedly using a typical phishing tactic of taking the identity of trusted associates of the victims to try to trick them into complying with the messages’ request for credentials, authorities said. She even impersonated one of the candidates in an attempt to steal credentials, they said.

Two-Phase Campaign
The first phase of the campaign sent two sets of phishing emails. One claimed to be from either the campaign’s managers or one of the campaign’s co-chairs and asked recipients to put their account credentials into an attached spreadsheet, or to click a link that connected them to a Google Form that also solicited credentials, according to the DoJ.

Lebeau also allegedly targeted the candidate’s spouse and other co-workers with messages that appeared to be either from Microsoft’s “Security Team” or from an employee of the workplace’s IT help desk.

“The emails… requested that recipients provide account credentials or other information about their computers by adding it to attached spreadsheets or on a website that mimicked the appearance of the employer’s legitimate website,” according to the DoJ.

The second phase of the campaign came two months later in March, when Lebeau allegedly sent phishing emails targeting another candidate for political office that claimed to be from the candidate’s cable and internet provider. These emails contained a false login link ostensibly for the purpose of addressing an issue with the candidate’s account that required the recipient to provide login credentials.

“Lebeau also impersonated this candidate in online chats with the cable and internet provider, in an attempt to reset and obtain the candidate’s account password,” according to the DoJ.

Too Lenient?
Lebeau faces a sentence of up to one year in prison, one year of supervised release, a fine of up to $100,000 and forfeiture for the charge, which takes into account that “Lebeau did not act with financial or political motive or to benefit any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent,” according to the DoJ.

However, one security expert criticized the leniency of the charge and its possible sentence, suggesting that the action should be taken just as seriously as if a foreign entity had been the attacker.

“This is an unexpected phishing campaign outcome in that the charging document does not indicate Lebeau acted with financial or political motives to ‘foreign government, instrumentality, or agent,'” Saryu Nayyar, CEO of security and risk analytics firm Gurucul said in an email to Threatpost. “Is that the only motive subjects we care about? This appears to be a politically motivated attack albeit domestic.”

Nayyar suggested that given the “toxicity” and drastic polarization of the current political climate in the United States, “extreme views” call for “extreme action,” and that Lebeau’s motives should not be taken so lightly.

“So what was this woman’s attack motive?” she asked. “Inquiring minds want to know.”"

Attackers sent 52M malicious messages leveraging the likes of Office 365, Azure, OneDrive, SharePoint, G-Suite and Firebase storage in Q1 2021.

Threat actors are cashing in on the rapid shift to cloud-based business services during the pandemic, by hiding behind ubiquitous, trusted services from Microsoft and Google to make their email phishing scams look legit. And it’s working.

In fact, in the first three months of 2021 alone, researchers found 7 million malicious emails sent from Microsoft 365 and a staggering 45 million sent from Google’s infrastructure, Proofpoint reported, adding that cybercriminals have used Office 365, Azure, OneDrive, SharePoint, G-Suite and Firebase storage to send phishing emails and host attacks.

“The malicious message volume from these trusted cloud services exceeded that of any botnet in 2020, and the trusted reputation of these domains, including outlook.com and sharepoint.com, increases the difficulty of detection for defenders,” the report, issued Wednesday, explained. “This authenticity perception is essential, as email recently regained its status as the top vector for ransomware; and, threat actors increasingly leverage the supply chain and partner ecosystem to compromise accounts, steal credentials and siphon funds.”



Because breaching a single account could potentially provide sprawling access, ProofPoint reported that 95 percent of organizations were targeted for cloud account compromise, and of those, more than half were successful. Additionally, more than 30 percent of those organizations that were compromised “experienced post-access activity including file manipulation, email forwarding and OAuth activity.”

Once attackers have credentials, they can easily move in and out of a range of services and use those to send additional, convincing phishing emails.

Proofpoint provided several examples of campaigns hiding behind Microsoft and Google that attempted to scam users into giving up their information or delivering malware.

One message used a Microsoft SharePoint URL, which purported to link to a document outlining COVID-19 guidelines. Proofpoint’s team reported that this message was sent to 5,000 users in the transportation, manufacturing and business services sectors.

Another example provided by Proofpoint attempted to use the domain name “onmicrosoft.com” to deliver a fake video-conferencing credential harvesting email, which researchers observed was delivered to about 10,000 users.



Attackers used Gmail to host another campaign starting in March, which delivered a fraudulent benefits message along with a Microsoft Excel attachment, which when macros were enabled, delivered The Trick banking trojan to steal credentials.

Another Gmail-hosted attack in February tries to induce users to access zipped MS Word documents by entering their passwords. Once opened, macros were enabled it delivered Xorist ransomware.



Attackers’ use of Gmail and Microsoft to lend a patina of legitimacy to their emails is part of a wider trend: Threat actors are generating increasingly convincing lures.

And at the tail end of May, Cofense flagged a phishing campaign using an Office SharePoint theme to bypass security gateways.

“Our research clearly demonstrates that attackers are using both Microsoft and Google infrastructure to disseminate malicious messages and target people, as they leverage popular cloud-collaboration tools,” The Proofpoint report added. “When coupled with heightened ransomware, supply chain, and cloud account compromise, advanced people-centric email protection must remain a top priority for security leaders.”"

‘Freevaccinecovax.org’ claimed to be that of a biotech company but instead was stealing info from visitors to use for nefarious purposes.

Federal law enforcement in Maryland has shut down a fraudulent website targeting immigrant communities that claimed to be for a company developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, the site was stealing information from people with the purpose of using it for future cybercriminal activity.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland, working with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Baltimore, seized “Freevaccinecovax.org,” “which purported to be the website of an actual biotechnology company developing a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus,” according to a release on the office’s website posted earlier this week.

Instead, the site was collecting personal information from people who visited it “in order to use the information for nefarious purposes, including fraud, phishing attacks, and/or deployment of malware.”

The site used trademarked logos for Pfizer, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on its home page to dupe visitors into thinking it was a legitimate site, according to the release. It collected visitor information by using a drop-down menu asking people to select their city and then apply for information by downloading a PDF file to their computers.

The PDF that the site offered to users was written in Cyrillic, suggesting that fraudsters were targeting immigrant communities of people from former Soviet countries of Belarus, Khazakstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Ukraine, who use Cyrillic script in their native languages. A domain analysis conducted by HSI indicated the domain name was created on April 27, using an IP address located in Strasbourg, France and a registrant country listed as Russia.

“It’s a scary thought but what HSI wants the public to understand is, all a bad guy needs to defraud thousands of Americans in search of COVD-19 information is the ability to create a website combined with malicious intent,” said James Mancuso, special agent in charge for the HSI Baltimore Field Office. “We must make an example of these perpetrators in order to deter others from committing these crimes against an unsuspecting and vulnerable internet user.”

Clicking on the site now greets users with a message that the site has been seized by the federal government and redirects them to another site for additional information. Seizing the site also means that third parties can’t use the name and use it to commit additional crimes, according to the feds.

“The domain itself and the operation associated with it illustrate just how useful the COVID-19 pandemic has been for malicious actors looking to cash in on other people’s misery,” Eric Howes, principal lab researcher at KnowBe4, said via email. “A bogus vaccine website offers bad actors a wide range of potential social-engineering schemes, from offers for free access to vaccine supplies to bogus investment schemes. COVID-19 has been the gift that keeps on giving for fraud artists over the past year.”

COVID-19 Vax Attracts Crooks
Indeed, since news of their development, the various vaccines for COVID-19 of been of great interest to cybercriminals. Before they were available extensively, threat actors focused on stealing research and development (R&D) plans for the vaccines in cyber-espionage campaigns.

More recently, attacks have been aiming to benefit financially from people’s interest in getting the vaccine, something acknowledged by Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner, who said the latest domain seizure was the ninth fraudulent website shut down for “seeking to illegally profit from the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Indeed, upon vaccine rollout last December, cybercriminals leveraged various tactics, from simple phishing scams all the way up to sophisticated Zebrocy malware campaigns, to take advantage of the widespread media attention around the distribution of the vaccines.

The latest seizure is but a drop in the bucket, Howes warned: “While authorities are to be lauded for shutting down this domain, one wonders how many more of them pushing similar fraudulent schemes are out there on the internet,” he said. “Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? Moreover, how long will it be before the parties behind this operation simply set up another domain and continue their operations?”

Lenzner said the federal government will continue to “aggressively prosecute fraudsters” who aim to prey on people’s misunderstanding of how the vaccine is distributed. These misconceptions may especially be present in immigrant communities who don’t have the inherent understanding of the U.S. medical system’s rollout of the vaccine.

“Members of the public should not provide personal information or click on links in unsolicited emails and should remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not for sale,” he warned in a press statement."

Email Phishing,"Global Phishing Attacks Spawn Three New Malware Strains

The never-seen malware strains have ""professionally coded sophistication"" and were launched by a well-resourced APT using nearly 50 domains, one hijacked.

Two waves of global financial phishing attacks that swamped at least 50 organizations in December have delivered three new malware families, according to a report from FireEye’s Mandiant cybersecurity team.

On Tuesday, the team said that they’ve dubbed the hitherto-unseen malware strains  Doubledrag, Doubledrop, and Doubleback. What Mandiant called the “trifecta” spear-phishing campaign twice hit a wide swath of industries worldwide: first on Dec. 2, 2020, with a second wave launched between Dec. 11 and Dec. 18, 2020.

The US was the primary target for attacks in both waves, while EMEA and Asia and Australia shared equal suffering in the first wave.

These Are No Schlubs
Mandiant tracks the threat actor as UNC2529 and says that these guys are pros. Given the “considerable” infrastructure they have at their disposal, their carefully crafted phishing lures, and what the researchers called the “professionally coded sophistication” of the malware, the team says that the UNC2529 attackers seem “experienced and well-resourced.”

The UNC2529 gang researched their targets well, tailoring their phishing email subject lines to their intended victims. In one instance, the threat actors masqueraded as an account executive for a small, California-based electronics manufacturer, sending out seven phishing emails that targeted a slew of industries, from medical to defense. All of the emails contained subject lines that were specific to the products of the company that the threat actors were pretending to be associated with.

Three-Stage Process
The malware ecosystem used by UNC2529 consists of either a downloader (Doubledrag) or an Excel document with an embedded macro; a dropper (Doubledrop); and a backdoor (Doubleback).

The infection starts with phishing emails that are rigged with a link to download a malicious payload that contains a JavaScript downloader with code that’s heavily obfuscated in order to evade analysis. Once it’s executed, Doubledrag tries to download a dropper – Doubledrop – in the second stage of the attack chain. Doubledrop is an obfuscated PowerShell script designed to plant a backdoor into memory. It has two flavors: a 32-bit and a 64-bit instance of the Doubleback backdoor.

With all that set up, the backdoor gets to work inserting plugins and reporting back to its controllers.

“The backdoor, once it has the execution control, loads its plugins and then enters a communication loop, fetching commands from its C2 server and dispatching them,” Mandiant describes.  “One interesting fact about the whole ecosystem is that only the downloader exists in the file system. The rest of the components are serialized in the registry database, which makes their detection somewhat harder, especially by file-based antivirus engines.”

50 Domains Chugging Away
UNC2529 used a lot of firepower to run the December phishing attacks, Mandiant says. Nearly 50 domains supported the various phases of the campaigns. Meanwhile, the attackers did their due diligence, researching their targets to concoct convincing lures that would entice recipients to click. As well, one legitimate third-party domain was compromised.

The threat actors also worked hard to obfuscate the malware components. One tactic was the use of fileless malware, which runs in memory after initial infection, instead of storing files on the hard drive. According to analysis of telemetry data from Cisco, fileless malware was the most common critical-severity cybersecurity threat to endpoints during the first half of 2020. This use of fileless malware helped to flummox detection so that the threat actors could deliver what Mandiant called “a well coded and extensible backdoor.”

Dimiter Andonov, Senior Principal Reverse Engineer with Mandiant, told Threatpost in an email on Tuesday afternoon that the techniques employed in this new malware ecosystem – specifically, the file-less serialization on compromised systems – isn’t new, but it’s effective. “While the technique is not novel per se, few malware are known to use it and the result is that the malicious components are much harder to be detected,” Andonov says.

Mandiant assumes that the point of all this effort is profit: “The identified wide-ranging targets, across geography and industry suggests a financial crime motive,” it says.

The researchers say that Doubleback appears to be “an ongoing work in progress.” The team expects to see UNC2529 continue to compromise victims in all industries, around the world.

To keep from being pulled in by what Mandiant calls this “double trifecta,” the standard-issue “don’t click on suspicious links” advice applies, Andonov says. “As all of the phishing initial vectors depend on convincing the user to click a link or execute an attached file, the ‘don’t click on the suspicious links’ advice is the first line of defense,” he says. “In some spear-phishing campaigns the malicious email might appear to be sent by a coworker or a person who is known by the receiver, and in such cases it’s always a good practice to reach back to the sender before opening any attached files or click on a link.”"
Email Phishing,"Oscar-Bait, Literally: Hackers Abuse Nominated Films for Phishing, Malware

Judas and the Black Messiah may be a favorite for Best Picture at the 93rd Academy Awards on Sunday, but it’s a fave for cybercriminals too.

Anticipation surrounding the upcoming 93rd Academy Awards broadcast on Sunday is being used by scammers to trick people into giving up their credentials — they think they’re about to stream Oscar-nominated films, but the reality turns out to be much different.

Prior to the winners being announced during the ceremony, many film fans like to watch as many of the nominated movies as possible. Scammers know this and are ready to strike.

“In the hopes of watching an Oscar-nominated movie, users visited a site where they were shown the first few minutes of the film before being asked to register to continue watching,” a Kaspersky report issued Friday on the scam detailed. “During the registration, to confirm their region of residence, the victim was asked to enter their bank-card details. After some time, money was debited from the card, and as expected, the film did not continue to play.”

Titles From ‘Best Picture’ Oscar Categories Most-Abused
Films are also being used to spread malware. Over the past year, Kaspersky’s team of researchers identified around 80 malicious files associated with films nominated in the Oscars’ “Best Picture” category. Of those, 70 percent spread via links to purportedly watch one of three movies: Judas and the Black Messiah (the most-abused film, accounting to 27 percent of the malware); Promising Young Woman with 22 percent; and Trial of the Chicago 7, which was associated with 21 percent of the abused files.

Other Academy-Award-nominated film titles used in to spread malware include Nomadland (14 percent), Mank (6 percent), Minari (5 percent), The Father (3 percent) and Sound of Metal (3 percent), Kaspersky found.

The analysts added that this type of attack is common, but that security concerns are waning a bit thanks to the rise of streaming services and improved security surrounding video content.

“Cybercriminals have always tried to monetize users’ interest in various sources of entertainment, including movies,” Anton V. Ivanov, a security expert at Kaspersky said. “We see that big events in the film industry can boost some interest from the cybercriminal community, but today this type of malicious activity is not as popular as it used to be. Nowadays, more and more people are switching to streaming services, which are more secure because they do not require downloading files. Still, films serve as a popular lure to spread phishing pages and spam emails.”

Global Headlines Make Good Paydays for Scammers
Almost any worldwide headline-producing event is an opportunity for cybercriminals to cash in. Everything from holidays like Valentine’s Day to global sporting events like the FIFA World Cup are potential lures for victims excited to get in on the frenzy.

The best protection against these types of scams is educating users not to click on these malicious links in the first place.

“Teaching employees how to recognize phishing emails like these is just as important as putting in place protective systems,” Heather Paunet, senior vice president at Untangle, told Threatpost. “As security adversaries find creative new ways to infiltrate networks, keeping employees trained and up-to-date is necessary to strengthen your network security.”"
Whaling,"Robinhood Warns Customers of Tax-Season Phishing Scams

Attackers are impersonating the stock-trading broker using fake websites to steal credentials as well as sending emails with malicious tax files.

Attackers have targeted customers of stock-trading broker Robinhood with a phishing campaign aimed to steal their credentials and spread malware using fake tax documents, the company has warned.

Robinhood, which aims to make it easy for people to trade stocks online but has faced a number of regulatory and legal challenges along the way, sent an email to customers Thursday warning of a phishing scam “that may have reached some of our customers.”

Attackers targeted customers in two ways, according to the email. One attack vector used phishing emails with links to fake Robinhood websites prompting visitors to enter their login credentials, including authentication codes the company uses to help ensure the security of people’s accounts.



Other emails saw attackers taking advantage of tax season, asking potential victims to download fake tax files—such as Form 1099—that included malware, according to the email.

“There tends to be an increase in these types of emails around tax season, so we ask that you be extra careful about how you access your Robinhood account,” according to the email.

Indeed, tax season is often an active time for online scammers, with cybercriminals taking advantage of the flurry of online activity as people scramble to file their IRS declarations in a process that has gone largely digital.

For any current Robinhood customers who want to avoid falling victim to the phishing scams, the email recommended that people only download the company’s mobile app from Google Play or the Apple App Store, and use only the app or Robinhood.com to access their accounts or access tax forms.

Robinhood also suggested people check the strength of security features of the app on their devices, manually removing any devices they don’t recognize from accessing it and resetting passwords if they feel they may be at risk. The company also encouraged customers to reach out to its support team directly from the Robinhood app or its website.

That last option has been a difficult proposition in the past, one of the number of ways Robinhood recently has run afoul of customers and regulators alike, according to a detailed report in Bloomberg, which broke the story last August. Robinhood customers made 473 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission in the first half of 2020—about four times more than competing online trading platforms—which drew regulatory scrutiny and prompted an investigation.

One of the chief complaints among Robinhood customers was that they couldn’t reach the company for support, causing regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become de facto customer support for the platform’s customers.

Other missteps by the company and its CEO, Vlad Tenev, included a platform outage around the time of the coronavirus outbreak last March, causing customers who wanted to move their stocks during a time of market volatility to lose the opportunity to do so, and thus potentially thousands of dollars.

Robinhood also was a part of a massive trading debacle that involved GameStop in January, spurring a regulatory investigation and a customer class-action suit against the company earlier this year."

Attackers move on new CEOs, using transition confusion to harvest Microsoft credentials.

A new phishing scam is on the rise, targeting executives in the insurance and financial services industries to harvest their Microsoft 365 credentials and launch business email compromise (BEC) attacks, according to a new report from Area 1 Security.

These new, sophisticated attacks are aimed at C-suite executives, their assistants and financial departments, and can work around email security and Office 365 defenses. Researchers added, most of the attacks they intercepted attempted to breach financial departments. Researchers said the attacks started last December and continued through February.

“By targeting the financial departments of these companies, the attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data of third parties through invoices and billing, commonly referred to as a BEC (Business Email Compromise) attack,” researchers said in the Thursday report. “This enables the attackers to send forged invoices from legitimate email addresses to suppliers, resulting in payments being made to attacker-owned accounts.”



These threat actors also specifically look for new CEOs during their transition periods, when they’re likely onboarding for payroll and other internal systems.

“This particular phishing campaign targeted 40 of Area 1 Security’s clients across numerous industries,” Maaz Qureshi, Threat Response Analyst with Area 1 Security, told Threatpost. “The most targeted were within insurance and financial services. Judging from the size of this campaign, there are certainly many more organizations outside of our scope that have been targeted by these malicious actors.”

Anatomy of the Attack
In one version of the campaign, targets get a spoofed Office 365 security update, sent from domains with Microsoft-themed names to make them seem even more legitimate, researchers explained. The scammers have also properly configured SPF records to get by authentication protections, they added.

“In an effort to further avoid detection, the threat actors leveraged their Microsoft-imposter domains in the phishing attacks not long after they were registered,” the report explained. “This quick domain registration turnaround is a common tactic employed by scammers hoping to bait as many victims as possible before their newly registered domains are identified as phishing infrastructure.”

Another version of the attack involves taking over other accounts to send the phishing messages. The attackers spoof email addresses of known senders to evade detection.

The goal of the phishing email is to dupe victims into clicking on the “Apply Update” button, disguised as a security update, which takes them to a spoofed Office 365 login page.

“For both the HTML and HTM attachments, the credential harvesting site would automatically load in the victim’s browser once the file was opened,” researchers said.

Once deployed, the threat actors apply HTML “meta” refresh to load the credential harvesting site, which appears to be a Microsoft “Privacy Statement.” If they are duped into clicking on “Accept,” they are taken to a page that looks “identical” to the real thing, according to researchers.

“In some cases, the attackers were even more stealthy by prefetching the localized Office 365 sign-in,” Area 1 said. “If the victim entered their email address, the attacker would verify it was a valid Office 365 address. In instances where the entered email address used Conditional Access, a different single sign-on (SSO), Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), etc., the phishing kit would essentially break and the victim would simply be redirected to the legitimate sign-in experience.”

After a target submits their password, the threat actors have full control of their email and any other systems where the same password was used, researchers warned.

The attackers have employed a couple of new tactics for this attack, including the use of free front-end web development tools to create the fake Microsoft pages and their use of websockets to take and send the attackers screen shots of the victim’s activity after each click.

“In particular when a victim clicked the “Next” button after entering their email address and password,” the report added.

Microsoft is the Phishing Lure of Choice
What is not new is the use of Microsoft-related lures, including Office 365 and Teams in BEC attacks. Just recently, Cofense released a report which found that 45 percent of all the phishing emails sent in 2020 were Microsoft-themed.

“With the number of organizations migrating to Office 365, targeting these credentials allows the threat actor to gain access to the organization as a legitimate user to go undetected,” researchers with Cofense told Threatpost. They added that they “highly recommend organizations enable [multi-factor authentication] along with their [Office 365] migration/ implementation.”

Office 365 is a treasure trove of exploitable data, because it is so widely used by a remote workforce relying on the service as a central repository for data.

“SaaS platforms like Office 365 are a safe haven for attacker lateral movement, making it paramount to focus on user access to accounts and services,” Chris Morales with Vectra told Threatpost. “When security teams have solid information and expectations about SaaS platforms such as Office 365, malicious behaviors and privilege abuse are much easier to quickly identify and mitigate.”

To avoid such attacks, “when receiving an email that claims to originate from internally and requires clicking on a link or downloading an attachment, it is best practice to confirm the authenticity of the email,” Qureshi told Threatpost. “All employees should be versed in basic cybersecurity, such as refraining from clicking on external, unknown links,” he said."
Email Phishing,"Nim-Based Malware Loader Spreads Via Spear-Phishing Emails

nim malware nimzaloader 
Spear-phishing emails are spreading the NimzaLoader malware loader, which some say may be used to download Cobalt Strike.

The TA800 threat group is distributing a malware loader, which researchers call NimzaLoader, via ongoing, highly-targeted spear-phishing emails.

While previous Twitter analysis identified this loader as a mere variant of TA800’s existing BazaLoader malware, new research cites evidence that NimzaLoader is a disparate strain — with its own separate string-decryption methods and hashing algorithm techniques.

The malware loader is unique in that it is written in the Nim programming language. The use of Nim is uncommon for malware in the threat landscape, except in rare cases, such as a Nim-based downloader recently seen being used by the Zebrocy threat group. Because of this, researchers say malware developers may be using Nim to avoid detection by defense teams who may not be familiar with the language.



“Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim’s implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it,” said Dennis Schwarz and Matthew Mesa, researchers with Proofpoint on Wednesday, in a report shared with Threatpost before publication.

NimzaLoader is used as “initial-access malware” and was first discovered being distributed by the TA800 threat actor in February, said researchers. TA800 is an affiliate distributor of TrickBot and BazaLoader (also known as the BazarBackdoor, BazarCall, etc.). The campaign was spotted targeting about 100 organizations across approximately 50 verticals, Proofpoint researchers told Threatpost.

It is unclear what NimzaLoader’s primary purpose is at this time – however, some evidence suggests the loader is being used to download and execute the Cobalt Strike commodity malware as its secondary payload, researchers said.

BazaLoader Versus NimzaLoader
Some initial analysis of NimzaLoader by various researchers on Twitter has indicated that it may be a variant of BazaLoader, another loader used by TA800 that has the primary function of downloading and executing additional modules. But, researchers with Proofpoint pointed to evidence that they say shows NimzaLoader is not merely a BazaLoader variant: “Based on our observations of significant differences, we are tracking this as a distinct malware family,” they said.

They cited several major differences between NimzaLoader and BazaLoader: For instance, the two samples use different code-flattening obfuscators, different styles of string decryption and different XOR/rotate-based Windows API hashing algorithms, they said. Other tactics that set NimzaLoader apart include the fact that the malware doesn’t use a domain-generation algorithm and that it makes use of JSON in its command-and-control (C2) communications.

The Email Spear-Phishing Campaign

Researchers first observed the NimzaLoader campaign on Feb. 3, in the form of emails with “personalized details” for victims – including their names and company names.

The messages purport to come from a coworker, saying he is “late” driving into the office and asking the email recipient to check over a presentation. The message sends a URL link (which is shortened) that purports to be a link to a PDF preview.

If the email recipient clicks on the link, they are redirected to a landing page hosted on email marketing service GetResponse. That page links to the “PDF” and tells the victim to “save to preview.” This link in turn actually takes the victim to the NimzaLoader executable.

NimzaLoader Malware Executable 
Upon closer inspection, researchers found that NimzaLoader is developed using Nim (as evidenced by various “nim” related strings in the executable). The malware uses mostly encrypted strings, using an XOR-based algorithm and a single key per string. One encrypted string contains a timestamp and is used to set an expiration date for the malware. For instance, in one analyzed sample the expiration date was set to Feb. 10 at 1:20:55.003 p.m. – meaning the malware would not run after that date and time.

Most of the other strings contain command names. These commands include the ability to execute powershell.exe and inject a shellcode into a process as a thread. While the NimzaLoader C2 servers were down at the time of research, researchers said a public malware sandbox appeared to show the malware receiving a PowerShell command that ultimately delivered a Cobalt Strike beacon.

“We are unable to validate or confirm this finding, but it does align with past TA800 tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs),” they said.

TA800 Threat Group: The Future of NimzaLoader
Researchers linked NimzaLoader back to TA800, a threat group that has targeted a wide range of industries in North America, infecting victims with banking trojans and malware loaders.

According to Proofpoint researchers, TA800’s previous campaigns have often included malicious emails with recipients’ names, titles and employers, along with phishing pages designed to look like the targeted company. Researchers noted that the malware shows TA800 continuing to integrate different tactics into their campaigns.

“It is… unclear if Nimzaloader is just a blip on the radar for TA800—and the wider threat landscape—or if Nimzaloader will be adopted by other threat actors in the same way BazaLaoder has gained wide adoption,” said researchers."

microsoft office 365 phishing attack
A phishing attack targeting Microsoft users leverages a bogus Google reCAPTCHA system.

Microsoft users are being targeted with thousands of phishing emails, in an ongoing attack aiming to steal their Office 365 credentials. The attackers add an air of legitimacy to the campaign by leveraging a fake Google reCAPTCHA system and top-level domain landing pages that include the logos of victims’ companies.

According to researchers, at least 2,500 such emails have been unsuccessfully sent to senior-level employees in the banking and IT sector, over the past three months. The emails first take recipients to a fake Google reCAPTCHA system page. Google reCAPTCHA is a service that helps protect websites from spam and abuse, by using a Turing test to tell humans and bots apart (through asking a user to click on a fire hydrant out of a series of images, for instance).

Once victims “pass” the reCAPTCHA test, they are then redirected to a phishing landing page, which asks for their Office 365 credentials.



“The attack is notable for its targeted aim at senior business leaders with titles such as Vice President and Managing Director who are likely to have a higher degree of access to sensitive company data,” said researchers with Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ security research team on Friday. “The aim of these campaigns is to steal these victims’ login credentials to allow threat actors access to valuable company assets.”

Fake Phishing Emails: Voicemail Attachments
The phishing emails pretend to be automated emails from victims’ unified communications tools, which say that they have a voicemail attachment. For instance, one email tells users that “(503) ***-6719 has left you a message 35 second(s) long on Jan 20” along with a lone attachment that’s titled “vmail-219.HTM.” Another tells email recipients to “REVIEW SECURE DOCUMENT.”

When the victims click on the attachment, they then encounter the fake Google reCAPTCHA screen, which contains a typical reCAPTCHA box – featuring a checkbox that the user must click that says “I’m not a robot,” which then triggers the turing test.

After filling out the fake reCAPTCHA system, victims are then directed to what appears to be a Microsoft login screen. The login pages also contain different logos from the companies which victims work at – such as one containing a logo from software company ScienceLogic and another from office rental company BizSpace. This reveals that attackers have done their homework and are customizing their phishing landing pages to fit their victims’ profile, in order to make the attack appear more legitimate.

Victims are asked to input their credentials into the system; once they do so, a message tells them that the validation was “successful” and that they are being redirected.

“After giving the login credentials, the phishing campaign will show a fake message that says ‘Validation successful,'” said researchers. “Users are then shown a recording of a voicemail message that they can play, allowing threat actors to avoid suspicion.”

Researchers found a variety of phishing pages associated with the campaign, which were hosted using generic top level domains such as .xyz, .club and .online. These top level domains are typically utilized by cybercriminals in spam and phishing attacks. That’s because they can be purchased for less than $1 each – a low price for adding a level of believability to phishing campaigns.

More Phishing Attacks on Fake Google reCAPTCHA Tactic

Adversaries have been leveraging bogus reCAPTCHA systems in their attacks for years. For instance, in 2019, a malware campaign targeted a Polish bank and its users with emails containing a link to a malicious PHP file, which eventually downloaded the BankBot malware onto victims’ systems. The attackers used a fake Google reCAPTCHA system to seem more realistic.

Another phishing attack in February purported to be sent from a voicemail service and contained a link to play the voice message “Play Audi Date.wav,” eventually redirecting victims to a malicious site with a reCAPTCHA message.

Both of the above examples show that reCAPTCHA continues to be used in phishing attacks, as the tactic successfully adds legitimacy to the attack: “Similar phishing campaigns utilizing fake Google reCAPTCHAs have been observed for several years, but this specific campaign targeting executives across specific industry verticals started in December 2020,” noted researchers.

Microsoft Office 365 users have faced several sophisticated phishing attacks and scams over the past few months. In October, researchers warned of a phishing campaign that pretends to be an automated message from Microsoft Teams. In reality, the attack aimed to steal Office 365 recipients’ login credentials. Also in October, an Office365 credential-phishing attack targeted the hospitality industry, using visual CAPTCHAs to avoid detection and appear legitimate. Phishing attackers have also adopted new tactics like Google Translate or  custom fonts to make the scams seem more legitimate."

Microsoft lure phishing email attack

As more organizations migrate to Office 365, cybercriminals are using Outlook, Teams and other Microsoft-themed phishing lures to swipe user credentials.

Almost half of phishing attacks in 2020 aimed to swipe credentials using Microsoft-related lures – from the Office 365 enterprise service lineup to its Teams collaboration platform.

According to a Tuesday report by Cofense, which analyzed millions of emails related to various attacks, 57 percent were phishing emails aiming to steal victim usernames and passwords. The remainder of malicious emails were utilized in business email compromise (BEC) attacks or for malware delivery.

Of those phishing emails, 45 percent were Microsoft-themed, said researchers: Cybercriminals are both relying on Microsoft-themed lures for their emails, as well as using ensuing phishing landing pages that either spoof or leverage legitimate Microsoft domains or services.



“With the number of organizations migrating to Office 365, targeting these credentials allows the threat actor to gain access to the organization as a legitimate user to go undetected,” researchers with Cofense told Threatpost. They added that they “highly recommend organizations enable [multi-factor authentication] along with their [Office 365] migration/ implementation.”

Microsoft Users Under Attack by Phishing Emails
Malicious email lures can vary; it could be a straightforward “‘Joe wants to share a document with you’ SharePoint alert you would normally see from Microsoft,” researchers explained — or it could be a simple attached file that includes a link to a website asking users to login with Microsoft credentials.

One phishing campaign in October pretended to be an automated message from Microsoft Teams telling victims they had a missed Teams chat. In reality, the attack aimed to steal Office 365 recipients’ login credentials.

Another December attack used embedded URLs that redirected to fake, never-seen-before Microsoft Office 365 phishing pages. The attack started with emails impersonating businesses like eFax, which is an internet fax service that allows users to receive faxes via email or online.

“We also see [cybercriminals] giving the user options to choose from the most commonly used email platforms,” said researchers. “The phishing emails often contain URLs hosted on legitimate domains that maintain a broad consumer base to avoid being blocked by content rules and filters.”

According to researchers, beyond the 45 percent of credential-stealing phishing attacks targeting Microsoft, the next-largest category was “generic”– meaning there wasn’t a specific brand associated with the email or the landing page asking the recipient to log in.

However, beyond Microsoft’s trusted collaboration services such as SharePoint, OneDrive or Office 365, researchers said they have seen other cloud provider products being leveraged in attacks. This includes Google (such as Google Forms), Adobe and file-sharing services.

“Other popular brands we observed asking for credentials were other various cloud hosting services such as Adobe, Dropbox, Box, DocuSign or WeTransfer,” researchers told Threatpost. “Threat actors have been able to scour the internet looking for file-sharing websites that are deemed ‘business related’ in order to make it past the secure email gateway controls, as well as the web proxy filters.”

Finance-Related Malicious Email Attacks
Researchers found that almost 17 percent of the emails identified as malicious were related to a financial transaction.

Many of these phishing emails may relate to invoices and transactions needed for work. One recent example of such an attack, for instance, involved invoice-themed emails sent to at least 20,000 mailboxes that purport to share information about an electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment. The emails found earlier this month carried a fairly vanilla subject line, “TRANSFER OF PAYMENT NOTICE FOR INVOICE,” and contain a link to download an “invoice” from the cloud.

These types of attacks work because “finance teams are under extreme pressure to process invoices and payments in a timely fashion to keep the business running, especially during month- or quarter-end when financial reporting is critical,” said researchers. “So, if a user hasn’t heard anything back about the email they reported, they will most likely interact with that message.”

The Rise of the GuLoader Malware
Researchers found that in 2020, the GuLoader dropper rose as one of the top malware delivery mechanisms in email attacks.

The malware, which first appeared in the first quarter and surged during the second quarter of 2020, is used to deliver remote administration tools, keyloggers, credential stealers and other malware phenotypes.

For instance, one June email campaign was discovered targeting mid-level employees across Austria, Germany and Switzerland with malicious Excel attachments. Once opened, and with macros enabled, the Microsoft Excel attachments would then download and execute GuLoader, which in turn would download and execute the Hakbit ransomware.

The malware’s advanced techniques make it a lucrative tool for cybercriminals to utilize to sidestep network- and email-security detections. For instance, the malware contains false code instructions designed to thwart analysis tools and a wide array of tricks to avoid executing in virtual or sandbox environments, said researchers. The attackers behind the malware also store their malicious payloads on cloud platforms like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive – which because they are legitimate services, are not frequently blocked.

“While GuLoader is an executable, it is normally deployed through weaponized office documents that are built to bypass security controls and download the malware directly from the victim’s computer system,” said researchers. “GuLoader’s continued evolution of sophisticated delivery and execution techniques make it increasingly useful in delivering threats.”"

Microsoft users are receiving emails pretending to be from mail couriers FedEx and DHL Express – but that really steal their credentials.

Researchers are warning of recent phishing attacks targeting at least 10,000 Microsoft email users, pretending to be from popular mail couriers – including FedEx and DHL Express.

Both scams have targeted Microsoft email users and aim to swipe their work email account credentials. They also used phishing pages hosted on legitimate domains, including those from Quip and Google Firebase – allowing the emails to slip by security filters built to block known bad links.

“The email titles, sender names and content did enough to mask their true intention and make victims think the emails were really from FedEx and DHL Express respectively,” said researchers with Armorblox on Tuesday. “Emails informing us of FedEx scanned documents or missed DHL deliveries are not out of the ordinary; most users will tend to take quick action on these emails instead of studying them in detail for any inconsistencies.”

FedEx Phishing Emails: Using Quip, Google Firebase
The phishing email spoofing American multinational delivery services company FedEx was entitled, “You have a new FedEx sent to you,” with a date that the email was sent.

This email contained some information about the document to make it seem legitimate – such as its ID, number of pages and type of document – along with a link to view the supposed document. If the recipients clicked on the email, they would be taken to a file hosted on Quip. Quip, which comes in a free version, is tool for Salesforce that offers documents, spreadsheets, slides, and chat services.

“We have observed a continuing trend of malicious actors hosting phishing pages on legitimate services like Google Sites, Box and Quip (in this case),” said researchers. “Most of these services have free versions and are easy to use, which make them beneficial for millions of people around the world, but unfortunately also lower the bar for cybercriminals to launch successful phishing attacks.”

This page contained the FedEx logo and was titled “You have received some incoming FedEx files.” It then included a link for victims to review the supposed document. Once the victims clicked on this page, they would finally be taken to a phishing page that resembled the Microsoft login portal, which is hosted on Google Firebase, a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Google Firebase has increasingly been utilized by phishing attacks over the past year to sidestep detection.

Of note, if a victim enters their credentials on the page, it re-loaded the login portal with an error message asking the victim to enter correct details.

“This might point to some backend validation mechanism in place that checks the veracity of entered details,” said researchers. “Alternately, attackers might be looking to harvest as many email addresses and passwords as possible and the error message will keep appearing regardless of the details entered.”

DHL Express Phishing Attack: Curious Adobe Login Prompt
A separate campaign impersonated German international courier DHL Express, with emails telling recipients that “Your parcel has arrived,” with their email addresseses at the end of the title.

The email told recipients that a parcel could not be delivered to them due to incorrect delivery details – and that the parcel is instead ready for pickup at the post office.

The email prompted recipients to check out attached “shipping documents” if they want to receive their delivery. The attached document was an HTML file (titled “SHIPPING DOC”) that, when opened, previewed a spreadsheet that looked like shipping documents.

The preview was  layered over with a login request box impersonating Adobe’s PDF reader. Researchers noted that it’s possible that attackers were trying to phish for Adobe credentials – but it’s more likely that they were trying to get victims’ work email credentials.

“The email field in the login box was pre-filled with the victim’s work email,” said researchers. “Attackers are banking on victims to think before they act and enter their work email password into this box without paying too much attention to the Adobe branding.”

Similarly to the FedEx phishing attack, when victims entered their details on this page, it returned an error message.

Tapping into COVID-19 Trends
With COVID-19 making more people turn to online platforms for purchasing goods, groceries and various household accessories – rather than in-person stores – online shipping is at an all-time high.

Cybercriminals are tapping into this, as seen in these recent phishing emails – but they have also leveraged many other tinely lures, from Covid-19 relief funds,  vaccine rollouts and personal protective equipment (PPE) needs.

“During the pandemic, we have all been getting online deliveries, often contactless deliveries and being in mail correspondence with FedEx/DHL is thus a common part of our lives now,” Preet Kumar, director of Customer Success at Armorblox told Threatpost. “Attackers are banking on victims buying into the legitimacy of this email and taking quick action without thinking about it too much.”"

A second malware that targets Macs with Apple’s in-house M1 chip is infecting machines worldwide — but it’s unclear why.

Hard on the heels of a macOS adware being recompiled to target Apple’s new in-house processor, researchers have discovered a brand-new family of malware targeting the platform.

Curiously, in the samples seen so far by analysts at Red Canary, the malware (dubbed Silver Sparrow) has been executing on victim machines with the final payload yet to be determined. It appears to be lying in wait for further instructions, which is worrying because it’s clear that the authors are advanced and sophisticated adversaries, researchers said.

Silver Sparrow has taken flight in any event: As of February 17, this fresh entry to the malware scene had already infected 29,139 macOS endpoints across 153 countries, according to researchers – primarily in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

A Word About the Benefits of the Mac M1
Apple released the M1 system-on-a-chip (SoC) last fall, marking the first time that the tech giant has created its own desktop/laptop silicon. The pivot from the Intel chips that Macs used before comes with a few benefits, such as faster performance for native applications. It also integrates a graphics processor, a machine-learning neural engine and the company’s T2 security chip. And, it uses ARM architecture, which usually powers mobile or portable devices. The smaller ARM profile translates into lower power consumption, and, Apple says, double the battery life.

With new Macs starting to roll out, cybercriminals are now turning their attention to these M1-powered targets, as evidenced by the emergence of a rebooted “Pirrit” adware detailed by Patrick Wardle this week. And now, the Silver Sparrow malware family has appeared on the scene – a brand-new malware built for the Mac M1 ecosystem, researchers said.

Silver Sparrow Leaves the Nest
Silver Sparrow is very likely an adware, according to researchers at Red Canary. It has two versions – one that targets Intel-based Macs, and one that is built to infect both the older and M1-based devices. Most notably, it uses JavaScript for execution – a rarity in the macOS malware world.

“Though we haven’t observed Silver Sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its forward-looking M1 chip compatibility, global reach, relatively high infection rate and operational maturity suggest Silver Sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice,” researchers said in a posting on Thursday.

It’s unclear how the malware is spreading – though both binaries have “package” in their names, lending a clue. Researchers noted, “We’ve found that many macOS threats are distributed through malicious advertisements as single, self-contained installers in PKG or DMG form, masquerading as [updates for a legitimate application]”—such as Adobe Flash Player, as an example.

Cloud-Hosted Infrastructure
Silver Sparrow’s infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services S3 cloud platform, according to Red Canary. And, the callback domains it uses are hosted through Akamai’s content delivery network (CDN).

“This implies that the adversary likely understands…this hosting choice allows them to blend in with the normal overhead of cloud infrastructure traffic,” researchers noted. “Most organizations cannot afford to block access to resources in AWS and Akamai. The decision to use AWS infrastructure further supports our assessment that this is an operationally mature adversary.”

JavaScript-Based Malware Development
Other signs of sophistication are evident in the malware’s construction. For instance, to start its installation, Silver Sparrow uses the macOS Installer JavaScript API to execute suspicious commands, the analysis found. That’s an unusual approach, according to Red Canary.

“While we’ve observed legitimate software doing this, this is the first instance we’ve observed it in malware,” researchers said. “This is a deviation from behavior we usually observe in malicious macOS installers, which generally use preinstall or postinstall scripts to execute commands.”

Using malicious JavaScript commands and the legitimate macOS Installer process has the benefit of limiting visibility into the contents of the installation package, the firm added.

Once installed, Silver Sparrow uses Apple’s system.run command for execution.

“Apple documented the system.run code as launching ‘a given program in the Resources directory of the installation package,’ but it’s not limited to using the Resources directory,” researchers explained. “As observed with Silver Sparrow, you can provide the full path to a process for execution and its arguments. By taking this route, the malware causes the installer to spawn multiple bash processes that it can then use to accomplish its objectives.”

This gives the developers a lot of flexibility when it comes to evolving the malware over time, researchers said. The bash commands can be extended with arguments that write input to files on disk, which are written out line-by-line with JavaScript commands. This is a choice that will let the adversary quickly modify the code and ease development, according to Red Canary – and, it helps the malware to avoid simple static antivirus signatures by dynamically generating the script rather than using a static script file.

Once fully executed, Silver Sparrow leaves two scripts on an infected disk: /tmp/agent.sh and ~/Library/Application Support/verx_updater/verx.sh.

The agent.sh script executes immediately at the end of the installation to contact the command-and-control (C2) server to indicate that installation has successfully occurred. The verx.sh script meanwhile executes periodically, using a persistent LaunchAgent to contact a remote host for more information, including to check for additional content to download and execute.

“LaunchAgents provide a way to instruct launchd, the macOS initialization system, to periodically or automatically execute tasks,” researchers explained. “Every hour, the persistence LaunchAgent tells launchd to execute a shell script that downloads a JSON file to disk, converts it into a plist, and uses its properties to determine further actions.”

A Mystery End Goal: Mac Adware?
In observing the malware’s check-ins to the C2 for over a week, none of the nearly 30,000 affected hosts downloaded what would be the next or final payload. This would presumably be a component that would carry out malicious actions like data exfiltration, cryptomining, ransomware, adware or DDoS bot enslavement, to name a few possibilities.

In other words, Silver Sparrow’s wings are clipped, for now.

“The ultimate goal of this malware is a mystery,” researchers said. “We have no way of knowing with certainty what payload would be distributed by the malware, if a payload has already been delivered and removed, or if the adversary has a future timeline for distribution.”

A clue as to what its developers may be going for exists at the end of the installation routine, researchers noticed.

“At the end of the installation, Silver Sparrow executes two discovery commands to construct data for a curl HTTP POST request indicating that the installation occurred. One retrieves…the URL used to download the original package file,” they explained. “By executing a sqlite3 query, the malware finds the original URL the .PKG downloaded from, giving the adversary an idea of successful distribution channels. We commonly see this kind of activity with malicious adware on macOS.”

Odd Placeholder Binaries
Silver Sparrow contains a further mystery in the form of placeholder binaries.

Both versions of Silver Sparrow have an extraneous Mach-O binary that appears to play no additional role in their execution.

“Ultimately this binary seems to have been included as placeholder content to give the PKG something to distribute outside the JavaScript execution,” analysts noted.

The Intel-only version simply says, “Hello, World!”; and the M1-compatible sample displays the message “You did it!”

“Based on the data from script execution, the binary would only run if a victim intentionally sought it out and launched it. The messages we observed of ‘Hello, World!’ or ‘You did it!’ could indicate the threat is under development in a proof-of-concept stage or that the adversary just needed an application bundle to make the package look legitimate,” Red Canary concluded.

The callback domain for the M1 version of Silver Sparrow was created Dec. 5, shortly after the SoC launched. In all, having two different malwares – Wardle’s discovery and Silver Sparrow – circulating already for what remains a limited platform is a notable development, researchers said. And Apple is already planning M1’s successor, the M1x chip, so the development work necessary to target this platform is far from finished. Is it worth malware authors’ time?

That remains to be seen, but “this is significant because the M1 ARM64 architecture is young, and researchers have uncovered very few threats for the new platform,” researchers noted."

A security flaw in TikTok could have allowed attackers to query query the platform’s database – potentially opening up for privacy violations.

A vulnerability in the popular TikTok short-form video-sharing platform could have allowed attackers to easily compile users’ phone numbers, unique user IDs and other data ripe for phishing attacks.

TikTok, owned by ByteDance, has more than 800 million active users worldwide. The vulnerability, which was reported and patched before its disclosure on Tuesday, existed in the “Find Friends” feature of the TikTok mobile app. This feature allows users to find their friends, either via their contacts, via Facebook or by inviting friends.

In order to help users find friends through their contacts, TikTok contained a sync feature for contacts who had TikTok accounts. That means that it is possible to connect profile details with phone numbers. Researchers said an attacker could leverage this feature in order to query TikTok’s entire database – potentially opening up for privacy violations.



“The vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to build a database of user details and their respective phone numbers,” said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point. “An attacker with that degree of sensitive information could perform a range of malicious activities, such as spear phishing or other criminal actions.”

The Attack
To launch an attack, a bad actor would need to first bypass TikTok’s HTTP message signing mechanism, which aims to protect threat actors from tampering with HTTP messages or modifying the body of the HTTP request.

Researchers were able to achieve this using TikTok’s own signing service, executed in the background. By using a dynamic analysis framework like Frida, an attacker could hook the function, change the data of the function’s arguments (in this case the contacts the attacker wants to sync) and re-sign the modified request to send to the TikTok application server.

From there, an attacker could automate the process of uploading and syncing contacts at a large scale. This could allow them to build a database of users and their connected phone numbers. Other profile details that would be accessible include the nickname associated with the account, profile and avatar pictures, unique user IDs, as well as certain profile settings, such as whether a user is a follower or if user’s profile is hidden. This type of data can give attackers the tools they need for social-engineering attacks used in phishing and spear-phishing emails. For instance, if an attacker demonstrates to a phishing victim that they have their phone number or unique user ID associated with their TikTok account, the victim is more apt to believe them.

One caveat of note is that this flaw could have only impacted users who had chosen to associate a phone number with their account, or who had logged in with a phone number. Neither of these options is required for users.

Researchers disclosed their findings to ByteDance, which deployed a solution. Now, under the “Find Friends” feature, users can only invite their friends rather than discover contacts that have TikTok accounts.

“The security and privacy of the TikTok community is our highest priority, and we appreciate the work of trusted partners like Check Point in identifying potential issues so that we can resolve them before they affect users,” said a TikTok spokesperson in a statement. “We continue to strengthen our defenses, both by constantly upgrading our internal capabilities such as investing in automation defenses, and also by working with third parties.”

TikTok Flaws
TikTok, which has previously triggered controversy for its privacy policies, earlier in 2020 faced scrutiny over various vulnerabilities found in its platform. Researchers said the most serious vulnerability in the platform could allow attackers to remotely take control over parts of victims’ TikTok account, such as uploading or deleting videos, and changing settings on videos to make “hidden” videos public.

Vanunu urged TikTok users to “share the bare minimum when it comes to your personal data,” and “update your OS and applications to the latest versions.”"

East WP SMPT bug
A poorly configured file opens users up to site takeover.

Easy WP SMTP, a WordPress plugin for email management that has more than 500,000 installations, has a vulnerability that could open the site up to takeover, researchers said.

Easy WP SMTP allows users to configure and send all outgoing emails via a SMTP server, so that they don’t end up in the recipient’s junk/spam folder. Version 1.4.2 and below contains a flaw in the debug file that is exposed because of a fundamental error in how the plugin maintains a folder, according to researchers at GBHackers.

“[The vulnerability] would allow an unauthenticated user to reset the admin password which would enable the hacker to take complete control of the website,” according to a Monday posting.

This optional debug log is where the plugin writes all email messages (headers and body) sent by the website. It is located inside the plugin’s installation folder, “/wp-content/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/,” researchers said.

The log is a simple text file; and the plugin’s folder doesn’t have an index.html file, so that on servers that have directory listing enabled, hackers can find and view the log, paving the way for a username enumeration scan. This can allow attackers to find the admin login.

“Hackers can also perform the same task using the author achieve scans (/?author=1),” the researchers explained. “They access the login page and ask for the reset of the admin password. Then, they access the Easy WP SMTP debug log again in order to copy the reset link sent by WordPress. Once the link is received, they reset the admin password.”

Logging into the admin dashboard gives attackers run of the site, including the ability to install rogue plugins, the researchers said.

Users should update to the current version 1.4.4 to patch the issue.

Problematic Plugins
WordPress plugins continue to provide a convenient avenue to attack for cybercriminals.

In November, a security vulnerability was found in the Welcart e-Commerce plugin opens up websites to code injection. This can lead to payment skimmers being installed, crashing of the site or information retrieval via SQL injection, researchers said.

In October, two high-severity vulnerabilities were disclosed in Post Grid, a WordPress plugin with more than 60,000 installations, which opened the door to site takeovers. And in September, a high-severity flaw in the Email Subscribers & Newsletters plugin by Icegram was found to affect more than 100,000 WordPress websites.

Earlier, in August, a plugin that is designed to add quizzes and surveys to WordPress websites patched two critical vulnerabilities. The flaws could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to launch varying attacks – including fully taking over vulnerable websites. Also in August, Newsletter, a WordPress plugin with more than 300,000 installations, was discovered to have a pair of vulnerabilities that could lead to code-execution and even site takeover.

And, researchers in July warned of a critical vulnerability in a WordPress plugin called Comments – wpDiscuz, which is installed on more than 70,000 websites. The flaw gave unauthenticated attackers the ability to upload arbitrary files (including PHP files) and ultimately execute remote code on vulnerable website servers."
Email Phishing,"Major BEC Phishing Ring Cracked Open with 3 Arrests

bec phishing arrests
Some 50,000 targeted victims have been identified so far in a massive, global scam enterprise that involves 26 different malwares.

Three men suspected of participating in a massive business email compromise (BEC) ring have been arrested in Lagos, Nigeria.

A joint INTERPOL, Group-IB and Nigeria Police Force cybercrime investigation resulted in the arrest of the Nigerian nationals, believed to be responsible for distributing malware, carrying out phishing campaigns and extensive scams worldwide.

In a BEC attack, a scammer impersonates a company executive or other trusted party, and tries to trick an employee responsible for payments or other financial transactions into wiring money to a bogus account. Attackers usually conduct a fair amount of recon work, studying executive styles and uncovering the organization’s vendors, billing system practices and other information to help mount a convincing attack.



The elements of this particular campaign are myriad, according to INTERPOL: The suspects are alleged to have developed phishing links and domains, then carrying out mass-emailing campaigns where they impersonated employees at various organizations.

Upon successful social-engineering efforts, they then spread 26 distinct malware variants to victims, including spyware and remote access trojans (RATs), according to law enforcement. The samples included AgentTesla, Loki, Azorult, Spartan and the nanocore and Remcos RATs.

While investigations are still ongoing, some 50,000 targeted victims have been identified so far.

“These programs were used to infiltrate and monitor the systems of victim organizations and individuals, before launching scams and siphoning funds,” according to INTERPOL, in a Wednesday announcement. “According to Group-IB, the prolific gang is believed to have compromised government and private-sector companies in more than 150 countries since 2017.”

According to the year-long investigation, dubbed “Operation Falcon,” the gang in question is divided into subgroups, and a number of individuals are still at large.

“This group was running a well-established criminal business model,” said Craig Jones, INTERPOL’s cybercrime director. “From infiltration to cashing in, they used a multitude of tools and techniques to generate maximum profits. We look forward to seeing additional results from this operation.”

The news comes as the average wire-transfer loss from BEC attacks is significantly on the rise: In the second quarter of 2020 the average was $80,183, up from $54,000 in the first quarter, according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG).

While Nigeria and West Africa are still top hotspots for BEC gangs, the APWG report found that the rise in dollar amounts could be driven largely by one Russian BEC operation, which has been targeting companies for an average of $1.27 million per effort.

The Russian BEC group, Cosmic Lynx, was spotted prowling around earlier this summer by researchers at Agari. It has launched more than 200 BEC campaigns since July 2019, which have targeted individuals in 46 countries on six continents, according to Agari’s statistics. Favorite targets include Fortune 500 and Global 2,000 companies, which helps explain the large paydays."

Attackers are compromising email accounts from popular universities, including Purdue and Oxford, to launch attacks that get around DMARC and SPF.

Cybercriminals are hijacking legitimate email accounts from more than a dozen universities – including Purdue University, University of Oxford in the U.K. and Stanford University – and using the accounts to bypass detection and trick victims into handing over their email credentials or installing malware.

Dave Bagget, CEO and co-founder of INKY, told Threatpost that there is no indication of how the accounts were compromised — but he speculated that the victims fell for a credential-harvesting scheme. Bagget also said that this month researchers continued to see phishing emails from real university accounts, so some accounts appear to still be compromised.

“A student may never change an originally assigned password, or may share it with a friend or friends,” according to Inky researchers on Thursday. “A professor may give a student the password to an account for a particular project and never change it when the project is done. Hackers tapping around find these carelessly handled accounts, take them over, and change the passwords themselves, locking out the original owner.”



Researchers said in 2020 so far they have discovered a number of malicious campaigns using compromised emails from at least 13 different universities. The highest number of phishing emails detected came from compromised Purdue University accounts (2,068), stolen in campaigns from Jan. to Sept.

Behind Purdue University was Oxford (714 phishing emails detected), Hunter College (709) and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (393).

Threat actors have utilized these legitimate emails for different types of attacks. In one, victims received a message from a Stanford University account purporting to be a Microsoft “system message,” which tells users about the status of some quarantined messages. The email offered various links to view the quarantined messages, which, once clicked on, led to a Microsoft Outlook credential-harvesting site or would initiate a malicious code infection. An easy red flag here is that the sender’s email address is a legitimate university account — yet the email purports to come from Microsoft, researchers said.

However, what gives the cybercriminals a leg up in this incident is that the header of the email confirms that this phishing email originated from Stanford University servers, allowing the sender to pass Sender Policy Framework (SPF) filtering for university domains, researchers said. SPF is an email authentication method that aims to prevent sender address forgery.

The attackers were able to bypass SPF because the commercial organization of the victim has a policy accepting email from Stanford servers, according to researchers.

“Search-engine results also confirm that the address sending this phishing email corresponds to a real university profile (e.g., of a student, faculty member, staffer or research publication),” said researchers.

Attackers also utilize various different other lures in their use of compromised university emails to target victims. For instance, researchers unearthed emails from legitimate Oxford and Purdue accounts telling victims that they have a missed call and linking to an attachment that purports to be the voicemail.

In another incident, researchers said that the Oxford had an improperly configured Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server; a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. They claimed a bad actor was able to abuse this and cause it to automatically generate email addresses, from which phishing emails were then sent, said researchers.

“By using Oxford’s servers as an open mail relay, a bad actor was able to send phishing emails that passed both SPF and DMARC for the University of Oxford,” said researchers. “To prevent this type of abuse, SMTP servers must be configured to not accept and forward emails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by unauthenticated and authorized users.”

Threatpost has reached out to the Oxford for further comment on this incident.

Other threats have plagued the higher-education sector, including recent campaigns called “Silent Librarian” that have been actively targeting students and faculty at universities via spear-phishing campaigns. The eponymous threat group behind the attacks (also known as TA407 and Cobalt Dickens), which operates out of Iran, has been on the prowl since the start of the 2019 school year, launching low-volume, highly-targeted, socially engineered emails that eventually trick victims into handing over their login credentials.

Bagget noted that with the proliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic moving many classes and universities remote, cybercriminals have also upped their game with cyberattacks against the higher-ed sector.

“We started to detect these types of attacks in summer 2019, and the number of hijacked accounts increased during the pandemic lockdowns,” Bagget said. “The number of distinct schools targeted also increased in the pandemic.”"

microsoft teams phishing attack
Up to 50,000 Office 365 users are being targeted by a phishing campaign that purports to notify them of a “missed chat” from Microsoft Teams.

Researchers are warning of a phishing campaign that pretends to be an automated message from Microsoft Teams. In reality, the attack aims to steal Office 365 recipients’ login credentials.

Teams is Microsoft’s popular collaboration tool, which has particularly risen in popularity among remote workforces during the pandemic – making it an attractive brand for attackers to impersonate. This particular campaign was sent to between 15,000 to 50,000 Office 365 users, according to researchers with Abnormal Security on Thursday.

“Because Microsoft Teams is an instant-messaging service, recipients of this notification might be more apt to click on it so that they can respond quickly to whatever message they think they may have missed based on the notification,” said researchers in a Thursday analysis.



The initial phishing email displays the name “There’s new activity in Teams,” making it appear like an automated notification from Microsoft Teams.

As seen in the picture below, the email tells recipient that their teammates are trying to reach them, warning them they have missed Microsoft Team chats and showing an example of a teammate chat that asks them to submit something by Wednesday of next week.

Erin Ludert, data scientist at Abnormal Security, told Threatpost researchers suspect attackers are using more of a “spray” tactic here, as the employee referenced in the chats doesn’t appear to be an employee of the company that received the attack.

To respond, the email urges the recipient to click on the “Reply in Teams” button – However, this leads to a phishing page.

“Within the body of the email, there are three links appearing as ‘Microsoft Teams’, ‘(contact) sent a message in instant messenger’, and ‘Reply in Teams’,” according to researchers. “Clicking on any of these leads to a fake website that impersonates the Microsoft login page. The phishing page asks the recipient to enter their email and password.”

Researchers said that the phishing landing page also looks convincingly like a Microsoft login page with the start of the URL containing “microsftteams.” If recipients are convinced to input their Microsoft credentials into the page, they are unwittingly handing them over to attackers, who can then use them for an array of malicious purposes – including account takeover.

With the ongoing pandemic, worries about cyberattackers leveraging enterprise friendly collaboration brands like Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Skype have been piqued. In May, a convincing campaign that impersonated notifications from Microsoft Teams in order to steal the Office 365 credentials of employees circulated, with two separate attacks that targeted as many as 50,000 different Teams users.

Microsoft is top of the heap when it comes to hacker impersonations – with Microsoft products and services featuring in nearly a fifth of all global brand phishing attacks in the third quarter of this year. Attackers are also using sophisticated tactics – including visual CAPTCHAS to target Office 365 users and token-based authorization methods."

facebook phishing attack
Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Facebook and WhatsApp are top brands leveraged by cybercriminals in phishing and fraud attacks – including a recent strike on a half-million Facebook users.

Facebook has been a top cybercriminal favorite in phishing attacks so far this year, with recent research shedding light on 4.5 million phishing attempts that have leveraged the social media platform between April and September 2020.

Behind Facebook, messenger app WhatsApp is the second-top platform leveraged by attackers (with 3.7 million phishing attempts), followed by Amazon (3.3 million attempts), Apple (3.1 million attempts) and Netflix (2.7 million attempts).

Google’s offerings (including YouTube, Gmail and Google Drive) took sixth position, with 1.5 million phishing attempts altogether according to a Tuesday analysis released by Kaspersky.

Of note, many of these targeted web services are also frequently accessed by employees of small and medium businesses while working — potentially opening up risks for sensitive corporate data, researchers warned.

“We can’t imagine our daily lives, and work, without different web services, including social media, messenger apps and file-sharing platforms,” said Tatyana Sidorina, security expert at Kaspersky, in a statement. “However, it is important for any organization to understand where threats may come from, and what technology and awareness measures are needed to prevent them. Businesses also need to provide their employees with comfortable use of services they require, so it is crucial to get the balance right.”



Facebook’s incredible user base — with more than 2.7 billion monthly active users as of the second quarter of 2020 – makes it an attractive brand for cybercriminals to tap into. The social-media giant’s access to a slew of private data, such as private messages, is another reason why attackers are leveraging Facebook.

In fact, just this week a report shed light on a Facebook phishing campaign that hit at least 450,000 victims. The attack sent Facebook users a link via Messenger that appeared to be a YouTube video. However, when victims clicked on the link, they were redirected to multiple websites and ultimately led to a Facebook phishing page. The attackers were then able to collect victims’ Facebook credentials.

Previous cybercriminals have also targeted Facebook over the years with new tricky tactics, including reproducing a social login prompt in a “very realistic format” inside an HTML block, and targeting Facebook’s ad platform for years in an attack that siphoned $4 million from users’ advertising accounts.

Facebook is also one of the most-used services by corporate employees, with Kaspersky finding that YouTube and Facebook are the top two services that employees at small and medium businesses access on their corporate devices (Google Drive, Gmail and WhatsApp follow closely behind).

“With the two lists sharing many of the services, these results only confirm the trend that popular applications have become valuable platforms for fraudsters’ malicious actions,” according to researchers.

On the other side of the coin, the social-media platform is also a top blocked application by corporate companies. Other top blocked applications include Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and LinkedIn.

Researchers also noted that messengers, file-sharing or mail services are not commonly blocked, “likely because they are often used for working purposes as well as for personal needs.” These products — including Google’s services (Gmail and Google Drive) — are often still leveraged in targeted attacks by cybercriminals.

These statistics, which were obtained for the period between April and September using Kaspersky’s distributed antivirus network (the Kaspersky Security Network, or KSN), consist of depersonalized metadata which is voluntarily provided by KSN participants among Kaspersky customers, a spokesperson told Threatpost.

Researchers said that moving forward, companies should keep an eye out for emerging popular brands – like the TikTok short-form video application – with big user bases that scammers will inevitably flock to for phishing attacks and other malicious purposes.

“While organizations can have different priorities and permissions for what web services can be used by their employees, it is important for organizations to understand all of the relevant threats they could face and how they can infiltrate corporate endpoints,” according to researchers. “Once a web service becomes popular, it is likely that it will become a more attractive target amongst scammers.”"

amazon prime day
A spike in phishing and malicious websites aimed at defrauding Amazon.com customers aim to make Prime Day a field day for hackers.

Cybercriminals are tapping into Amazon’s annual discount shopping campaign for subscribers, Prime Day, with researchers warning of a recent spike in phishing and malicious websites that are fraudulently using the Amazon brand.

There has been a spike in the number of new monthly phishing and fraudulent sites created using the Amazon brand since August, the most significant since the COVID-19 pandemic forced people indoors in March, according to a Thursday report from Bolster Research.

“As shoppers gear up for two days of great deals, cyber criminals are preparing to prey on the unwary, taking advantage of those who let their guard down to snap up bargains,” researchers wrote.

Prime Day actually happens over two days—this year the event falls on Oct. 13 to 14. Amazon Prime customers enjoy special sales and discounts on top brands to mark the biggest shopping event of the year on the online retail giant’s site.

Amazon last year yielded over $7 billion in sales during the 36-hour event, which could go even bigger this year due to “the decline of brick and mortar retail and the close proximity to the holidays,” researchers noted. Indeed, mandatory stay-at-home orders globally that began with the COVID-19 pandemic in March have significantly boosted Amazon’s business, a trend that shows no signs of abating.

Researchers analyzed hundreds of millions of web pages to track the number of new phishing and fraudulent sites using the Amazon brand and logos. Its research shows threat actors taking advantage of both Amazon features and consumer behaviors to try to lure online shoppers to fraudulent sites that can steal their credentials, financial information and other sensitive data.

One new campaign targets “returns” or “order cancellations” related to Prime Day using a fraudulent site, www.amazoncustomersupport[.]net, that mimics a legitimate Amazon site. However, closer examination of the site shows it is clearly designed to defraud consumers, researchers noted.

One clear evidence is its use of a phone number, as “Amazon does not encourage customer service by phone, and takes a great effort to find phone support on the real Amazon site,” researchers wrote.

The form on the site also requests bank or credit card information from customers–a clear intent to steal this information, since Amazon always offers refunds to original form of payment or gift cards. Further, the site also does not ask for a customer password, something Amazon always requires for purchases and returns.

Other smaller issues that might be overlooked—such as broken links attached to the Amazon Prime Logo and a “Get Started” button–also appear on the site. These also are clues to fraudulent behavior that shoppers should look out for in general as they shop on Prime Day, researchers noted.

Another malicious site recently observed by researchers takes advantage of most consumers’ inherent love of a free gift. The site, www.fr-suivre[.]vip, promotes an Amazon loyalty program and offers a free iPhone 11 Pro if people answer a few survey questions. After answering these questions, people are directed to a simple game that they win, after which they’re asked to enter credit card info so the site can charge them $1 to receive the iPhone.

The site even includes a screenshot in which “the free iPhone is validated by many others who have already received their phones,” researchers wrote. “Despite the glowing reviews, the $999 phone will never arrive, and the shopper begins to see strange charges on the credit card number provided,” they warned.

Fortunately for Amazon Prime customers who plan to take advantage of the event this year—or anyone else shopping Amazon these days—avoiding online fraud is not that difficult, researchers said. All shoppers should start directly at the source—Amazon.com—and pay close attention to their experience to ensure that nothing is out of the ordinary.

“Shoppers need to be aware of cyber criminals prepared to take advantage of the situation,” researchers noted. “With some diligence and attention to detail, shoppers will be able to get those deals without getting scammed.”

Amazon, too, can take even more security steps to protect customers as its business continues to boom, with cybercrime inevitably following suit, observed Kevin Beasley, CIO at enterprise management software provider VAI.

“To minimize the risk of data breaches or security issues, retailers, like Amazon, must install additional multi-factor authentication for logins and policies to protect passwords and who has access to data,” he said in an email to Threatpost.

Online retailers across the board also should get out ahead of the busy holiday season by making their platform “a security-first environment,” Beasley said.

This can be done “by installing additional layers of security infrastructure between the operating system and hardware platform, and continuous security testing and automating scans of hardware and software systems to seek out vulnerabilities and patch potential issues as they arise,” he told Threatpost."

CAPTCHA phishing attack microsoft office 365
Cybercriminals set up three different CAPTCHAs that Office 365 targets must click through before the final phishing page.

Researchers are warning of an ongoing Office 365 credential-phishing attack that’s targeting the hospitality industry – and using visual CAPTCHAs to avoid detection and appear legitimate.

CAPTCHAs – commonly utilized by websites like LinkedIn and Google – are a type of challenge–response test used to determine whether or not the user is human, such as clicking on the parts of a grid that have a specific object pictured. Cybercriminals have previously utilized CAPTCHAs as a way to defeat automated crawling systems, ensure that a human is interacting with the page and make the phishing landing page appear legitimate.

Though the use of CAPTCHAS in phishing  attacks is nothing groundbreaking, this attack shows that the technique works – so much so that the attackers in this campaign used three different CAPTCHA checks on targets, before finally bringing them to the phishing landing page, which poses as a Microsoft Office 365 log-in page.



“Two important things are happening here,” said researchers with Menlo Security, in a post this week. “The first is that the user is made to think that this is a legitimate site, because their cognitive bias has trained them to believe that checks like these appear only on benign websites. The second thing this strategy does is to defeat automated crawling systems attempting to identify phishing attacks.”

Menlo Security’s Director of Security Research, Vinay Pidathala, told Threatpost said that researchers are unsure of how many users were specifically targeted, however, the industries targeted by this campaign were primarily technology, insurance, and finance and banking.

The multiple CAPTCHAs serve as backups, in case the first one gets defeated by automated systems, said researchers.

In the first CAPTCHA check, targets are simply asked to check a box that says “I’m not a robot.”

After that, they are then taken to a second CAPTCHA that requires them to select for instance all the picture tiles that match bicycles, followed by a third CAPTCHA asking them to identify, say, all the pictures that match a crosswalk. Attackers also do not use the same CAPTCHAs – researchers said, during their testing they came across at least four different images utilized.

Finally, after passing all these checks, the target is taken to the final landing page, which impersonates an Office 365 log-in page, in an attempt to steal the victims’ credentials.

As mentioned above, cybercriminals have relied on previous phishing attacks that leverage CAPTCHA systems to appear legitimate. For instance, a May phishing attack pretended to deliver subpoenas but actually was stealing user’s Office 365 credentials. And, in 2019, a phishing scam was found peddling malware, using a fake Google reCAPTCHA system to mask its malicious landing page.

Pidathala told Threatpost that researchers did not have insight into the lure used in the email campaign. However, “looking at our global customer telemetry, we think the campaign started on September 21, 2020,” he said. “We believe that the campaign is currently active and ongoing, although the probability of success might have decreased as security vendors would have hopefully added protections for this campaign by now.”

Researchers said, the attack shows that cybercriminals continue to switch up their tactics when it comes to phishing and email based attacks. Indeed, just in the past week, researchers have warned of innovative phishing techniques such leveraging OAuth2 or other token-based authorization methods, for instance, or phishing emails pretending to be Windows 7 upgrades.

“Phishing is the most prevalent attack vector affecting enterprises,” said researchers. “These attacks take advantage of our inherent cognitive biases and fool us into entering our credentials. That bias, combined with the tactics used by attackers, make these attacks very successful.”"

Attackers gain read-only permissions to snoop around Office 365 accounts, including emails, contacts and more.

An APT known as TA2552 has been spotted using OAuth2 or other token-based authorization methods to access Office 365 accounts, in order to steal users’ contacts and mail.

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for people to sign into services without entering a password — using signed-in status on another, trusted service or website. The most visible example might be the “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with Facebook” that many websites use in lieu of asking visitors to create a new account.

According to researchers from Proofpoint, targets receive a well-crafted lures asking them to click a link which carries them to the legitimate Microsoft third-party apps consent page.



“Once signed into their O365 (Office 365) account, the user is redirected to the official O365 consent process that prompts them to grant permissions to the actor’s application,” they explained. “The domains that catch the OAuth tokens are often registered via Namecheap and hosted on Cloudflare.”

There, they’re asked to grant read-only permissions to a (malicious) third-party application that’s masquerading as a real organization’s app.

Proofpoint researchers added that users should be aware of the permissions that these, and any, third-party apps are asking for. In the case of this campaign, the malicious apps are asking for read-only access to the user’s contacts, profile and mail – all of which could be used to snoop around accounts, silently steal data or even intercept password reset messages from other accounts, like online banking.

“Even read-only access comes with considerable risk,” according to a Proofpoint posting on Tuesday. “The ability to perform reconnaissance on an O365 account supplies an actor with valuable information that can later be weaponized in business email compromise (BEC) attacks or account takeovers…The minimal [read-only] permissions requested by these apps also likely help them appear inconspicuous if an organization’s O365 administrator audits connected apps for their users’ accounts.”

They added, “The apps don’t request many permissions, and those they do might not appear particularly far-reaching, allowing them to blend in with other benign apps.”

If consent is granted, the third-party application will be allowed to access the currently authenticated Office 365 account. If consent is denied, the browser is still redirected to an attacker-controlled page, giving the actor the opportunity to try again with a different tactic.

Further, if the browser is not already authenticated to Office 365 in the first place, the user is sent to the official Office 365 login page to sign in, researchers added, and then are asked to grant permissions again.

Proofpoint researchers said that organizations worldwide have received messages, but TA2552 seems to favor Spanish speakers in Mexico for this effort. For instance, the impersonation of the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT), Mexico’s tax authority, is a common message theme.

“When SAT is used in the phish lure, the email suggests that the recipient needs to update their contact information and is presented with what appears to be a link to do so,” Proofpoint noted. “Some subjects, like ‘Аcսse dе Сіta – Aсlaracіоոes 2020. (Acknowledgment of Appointment – Clarifications 2020.),’ make use of non-ASCII characters, possibly to evade simple spam filters.”

The firm added that while Mexican tax- and government-themed messages are the normal spoofing targets for the campaign, researchers also observed lures and apps impersonating Netflix Mexico and Amazon Prime Mexico.

“Threat actors often find creative ways to harvest information,” Proofpoint researchers said. “In these attacks, TA2552 doesn’t rely on techniques like more traditional credential-phishing or dropping malware on a system. Instead, they gain permissions to view the content and activity of resources available through a user’s O365 account. The departure from such traditional techniques gives this actor an advantage, as users likely aren’t trained to spot or inspect suspicious applications.”

OAuth Attacks on the Rise
In July, Microsoft warned against these kinds of attacks, which Agnieszka Girling, Partner Group PM Manager at Microsoft, warned were on the rise. Also known as consent phishing, it’s an easy attack to carry out, she said. Attackers need only to register a malicious app with an OAuth 2.0 provider, such as Microsoft’s own Azure Active Directory.

“The app is configured in a way that makes it seem trustworthy, like using the name of a popular product used in the same ecosystem,” explained Girling at the time. “The attacker gets a link in front of users, which may be done through conventional email-based phishing, by compromising a non-malicious website or other techniques. The user clicks the link and is shown an authentic consent prompt asking them to grant the malicious app permissions to data.”

If a user clicks accept, they will grant the bad app permissions to access their credentials and potentially other sensitive data, as in the campaign flagged by Proofpoint.

“The app gets an authorization code which it redeems for an access token, and potentially a refresh token,” Girling explained. “The access token is used to make API calls on behalf of the user. If the user accepts, the attacker can gain access to their mail, forwarding rules, files, contacts, notes, profile and other sensitive data and resources.”

Users can protect themselves by ensuring that whatever app they’re signing into is actually legitimate. They can also apply basic phishing-awareness strategies, such as looking for poor spelling and grammar in the original emails. Also, app names and domain URLs can offer red flags."

Attackers check the victims’ Office 365 credentials in real time as they are typed into the phishing landing page, by using authentication APIs.

Researchers have uncovered a phishing attack using a new technique: Attackers are making use of authentication APIs to validate victims’ Office 365 credentials – in real time – as they enter them into the landing page.

Authentication APIs are used by apps and services running on the users’ behalf to access their data, Prashanth Arun, head of Data Science at Armorblox, told Threatpost. Office 365 requires app registrations to use APIs – but registrations require only an email address, making them seamless for attackers to leverage. Some additional configuration for the app also requires users to specify a website to “receive” authentication info, Arun added.

In a phishing attack recently spotted by researchers, the attacker used the authentication APIs to cross check the credentials of a senior executive at a large enterprise firm with the organization’s Azure Active directory. Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s proprietary directory service, which allows administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources. The authentication APIs use Azure AD to provide authentication services.

In the phishing attack, access to this immediate feedback “allows the attacker to respond intelligently during the attack,” researchers with Armorblox said on Thursday. “The attacker is also immediately aware of a live compromised credential and allows him to potentially ingratiate himself into the compromised account before any remediation.”

The Phishing Email
The attack was first discovered targeting a senior executive at an unnamed company, which researchers say is an American brand named among the Top 50 most innovative companies in the world in 2019. The initial email sent to the employee had the subject line “ACH Debit Report,” mimicking an internal report, and was sent on Friday evening, when victims likely have their guard down, researchers said.

According to researchers, the targeted company had recently changed domains so the target’s public email address is different from the domain name used in his Active Directory login. Attackers were aware of this change, leading researchers to believe the campaign was highly targeted.

“The limited activity at the website hosting the phishing attack and the careful timing of the email to a Friday evening also suggests this is a carefully crafted attack,” researchers said. “Our estimates show there have been 120 odd visits to this website globally since the beginning of June. The sparse number shows that the phishing scams are likely targeted and not spray and pray.”

The phishing email told victims to: “Find enclosed Payment Remittance Report’ as of 7/11/2020 2:53:14 a.m. Thank you for your business!”and points to an attachment, which looks like a text file.

“Opening the attachment from Office 365 in a browser shows a website identical to the Office 365 sign on page. The username has been pre-entered. A non-standard message ‘Because you’re accessing sensitive info, you need to verify your password’ is noted,” said researchers.

Cross-Checking Credentials
Once victims entered their credentials into the phishing landing page, Azure Active Directory sign-on logs show an immediate sign-on attempt corresponding to XHR requests performed on the attachment webpage.

“There’s no special vulnerability that makes this possible, it’s a unique adoption of APIs by the adversaries,” Arun stressed in an email to Threatpost.

If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to zoom.com. However, if the authentication fails, the user is redirected to login.microsoftonline.com. This could be a way to hide the phishing attack as just another failed sign on attempt at the Office 365 portal, researchers said.  If the entered password text is empty or too short, the user is forced to retry.

“Our threat researchers verified the real-time nature of the site by updating the script with a test login and a dummy password and saw a failed login attempt from Provo, Utah in the Azure Active Directory Sign-In portal,” said researchers. “As expected, the IP address (162.241.120.106) that attempted the sign-in is the same endpoint the phishing script sends the credentials.”

Upon further investigation, researchers found that the web service behind the credential phishing page is hosted on teenagemoglen[.]com, which is registered at Alibaba.com with a Singapore domain registrar since the end of May 2020.

“The website is hosted by UnifiedLayer, a hosting company based out of India, at a datacenter in Provo, Utah, United States,” they said. “The website appears to host web pages copied from another website. None of the links which allow for active engagement with a visitor appear to be active.”"
Smishing,"China-based APT Debuts Sepulcher Malware in Spear-Phishing Attacks

The RAT has been distributed in various campaigns over the past six months, targeting both European officials and Tibetan dissidents.

A China-based APT has been sending organizations spear-phishing emails that distribute a never-before-seen intelligence-collecting RAT dubbed Sepulcher.

Researchers discovered the new malware being distributed over the past six months through two separate campaigns. The first, in March, targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations and global organizations dealing with economic affairs. The second, in July, targeted Tibetan dissidents. They tied the campaigns to APT group TA413, which researchers say has been associated with Chinese state interests and is known for targeting the Tibetan community.

“Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, [we] have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413,” said Proofpoint researchers in a Wednesday analysis. “The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413’s targets of interest.”

Two Campaigns
In March, researchers observed a phishing campaign that impersonated the World Health Organization’s guidance on COVID-19 critical preparedness. The emails contained a weaponized RTF attachment that impersonated the WHO’s “Critical preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19, Interim guidance” document. The guidance was initially published on March 7, while the weaponized attachment was delivered by threat actors on March 16, researchers said.

When a target clicks the weaponized RTF attachment (named “Covdi.rtf”), it exploits a Microsoft Equation Editor flaw in order to install an embedded malicious RTF object, in the form of a Windows meta-file (WMF), to a file directory (%\AppData\Local\Temp\wd4sx.wmf). The WMF file’s execution then results in the delivery and installation of the Sepulcher malware.

Sepulcher malware The second phishing campaign, starting at the end of July, targeted Tibetan dissidents with the same strain of Sepulcher malware.

The emails, which purported to come from the “Women’s Association Tibetan,” included a malicious PowerPoint attachment (titled “TIBETANS BEING HIT BY DEADLY VIRUS THAT CARRIES A GUN AND SPEAKS CHINESE.ppsx”). The email was targeting dissidents, with the attachment, once opened, referencing “Tibet, Activism and Information.”

When the PowerPoint attachment is executed, it calls out to the IP 118.99.13[.]4 to download a Sepulcher malware payload named “file.dll.”

“The attachment title, decoy content, impersonated sender, and “Dalai Lama Trust in India”-themed C2 affirms this campaign’s focus on individuals associated with the Tibetan leadership in exile,” said researchers.

Sepulcher Malware
Sepulcher is a basic RAT payload that has the abilities to carry out reconnaissance functionality within the infected host, including obtaining information about the drives, file information, directory statistics, directory paths, directory content, running processes and services.

Sepulcher malware Additionally, it is capable of more active functionalities, like deleting directories and files, creating directories, moving file source to destination, spawning a shell to execute commands, terminating a process, restarting a service, changing a service start type and deleting a service.

Researchers said that the Sepulcher malware “is far from groundbreaking,” but noted its combination with timely social-engineering lures around the pandemic.

They also pointed out that the campaign is reminiscent of a July 2019 campaign that was used to distribute ExileRAT; the TA413 APT group has also previously been documented in association with this RAT. ExileRAT is a simple RAT platform capable of getting system data (computer name, username, listing drives, network adapter, process name), getting/pushing files and executing/terminating processes.

Shifting Focus: COVID-19
Chinese APT TA413 is previously known for targeting Tibetan dissidents, as it did in its July campaign, so the March attack shows the skyrocketing trend of Chinese APTs branching out and adopting COVID-19 lures in espionage campaigns during the first half of 2020.

Researchers said, following an initial interest from Chinese APTs in targeting intelligence on the response of western global economies during the pandemic, this campaign shows a “return to normalcy” in more recent months.

“The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413’s targets of interest,” said researchers. “While best known for their campaigns against the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020, before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.”"

Researchers warn that a phishing scam is targeting Instagram users via direct messages on the app.

Turkish-speaking cybercriminals are sending Instagram users seemingly legitimate messages from the social media company, with the aim of stealing their Instagram and email credentials.

Researchers said that the campaign has been targeting hundreds of celebrities, startup business owners, and other entities with sizeable followings on Instagram. This specific attack first came on researchers’ radar after a police officer with more than 16,000 followers on Instagram was targeted, they said.

While previous phishing messages leveraging Instagram as a lure have been sent via email, the attackers in this campaign send the phishing messages on Instagram’s platform itself. They pretend to be the Instagram Help Center and claim that a copyright violation complaint has been filed against the account owner – and that their account is now at risk of being deleted.



“The message also provides a link which masquerades as a form for sending an appeal but which is actually a phishing link,” said researchers with Trend Micro in a Friday analysis. “Opening the link leads to a page where the user will be requested to provide their username. As of writing, the form has no data validation, meaning that any input — even a non-existent account or no input at all — would be accepted.”

Click to expand.

After the victim selects the “Next” button on the phishing landing page, another screen appears asking them for their name, password, email address and email password.

If a victim inputs his credentials and clicks the “Continue” button, the page redirects to the legitimate Instagram login page.

“If the user was already logged in to the social media site before tapping the said button, the form then redirects to their homepage,” said researchers. “This gives the illusion that the form they filled out is officially connected to Instagram.”

Once they have a hold of the Instagram credentials, attackers log into the account, unlink the victim’s cellphone number connected to the account, and change the email linked to the account. And, since they have the email credentials as well, attackers can take over the email account as well.

Attackers have previously targeted Instagram users in various phishing campaigns and scams. A previously 2019 campaign, for instance, used emails requesting the user to confirm their account so that they can receive a verified badge.

However, selecting the “Verify Account” button leads to a phishing page that harvests the user’s email address, credentials, and date of birth. Upon harvesting these, the threat actors have all the details they need to modify the information for recovering a stolen account, said researchers.

Many of the attacks were successful, Jindrich Karasek, threat researcher at Trend Micro, told Threatpost. The impact of the breach depends, Karasek said.

“Some victims can be famous enough to be blackmailed with information found on Google,” Karasek told Threatpost. “Most of the victims also use the same password for all social networks, so they get their whole online identity stolen, exploited and abused.”

Researchers advised Instagram users to be cautious of seemingly legitimate sites that request account credentials for another site.

Also, users should “examine message content for ungrammatical constructions and spelling mistakes” and “never open links or download attachments from suspicious sources. Hover over a URL to check if it reveals a different address other than the expected website,” said researchers.

More than 100 executives at a multinational company that’s part of a German task force for creating coronavirus protective gear, were targeted in an ongoing phishing attack.

Researchers are warning of an ongoing phishing attack that’s targeting the credentials of more than 100 high-profile executives at a German multinational corporation that’s tasked with procuring coronavirus medical gear for Germany.

The company, left unnamed by researchers, is part of a task force created March 30 by the German government and the private sector to procure personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers on the front lines of COVID-19, such as face masks and medical equipment. The task force consists of nine companies, including car manufacturer Volkswagen, pharmaceutical company Bayer, airline Lufthansa, chemical firm BASF and shipping company DHL, who are leveraging their access to foreign markets to purchase and deliver PPE to German ministries.

Researchers who discovered the phishing attack believe its perpetrators may be targeting multiple firms, and third-party supply chain partners, associated with the task force.



“The threat actors behind this campaign targeted more than 100 high ranking executives in management and procurement roles within this organization and its third-party ecosystem,” said Claire Zaboeva, cyber-threat researcher with IBM X-Force, in a Monday analysis. “Given the extensive targeting observed of this supply chain, it’s likely that additional members of the task force could be targets of interest in this malicious campaign, requiring increased vigilance.”

On March 30 (the same day the task force was created), “suspicious activity” was discovered related to the phishing attack. Zaboeva told Threatpost that the activity was uncovered in the wild and a copy of the initial phishing emails is not available.

The emails contained URLs that redirect the email recipients to a fake, attacker-controlled Microsoft login page that’s designed to steal user credentials. Once passwords have been inputted, they are then exfiltrated to several different email accounts hosted on Russian email service Yandex.

While it is unclear how many of the phishing attacks were successful, the attack could open the door to credential harvesting, which could allow threat actors to access victims’ email accounts. From there, they could collect or exfiltrate data of interest, or move laterally through the network for other malicious purposes, researchers said.

PPE phishing attack

Researchers tracked this suspicious activity to a Russia-based IP address (178[.]159[.]36[.]183). Overall, more than 280 URLs were found to be tied to that IP address. More than a third of these included Base64-encoded email addresses belonging to targets at the firm and its third-party supply chain partners.

Of those emails, half belong to the target company’s operations, finance and procurement executives. The other half belong to executives at third-party partners of the firm, including European and American companies associated with chemical manufacturing, aviation and transport, medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, finance, oil and gas, and communications, researchers said. About 40 companies have been subject to the targeted activity worldwide, Zaboeva told Threatpost.

“Based on our analysis, attackers likely intended to compromise a single international company’s global procurement operations, along with their partner environments devoted to a new government-led purchasing and logistics structure,” said researchers.

Researchers notified CERT BUND, which operates Germany’s national IT Situation Centre, about the activity. As many organizations worldwide ramp up PPE production to support medical professionals on the front lines of the coronavirus, they are part of an emerging “high-value target group” whose reliance on technology to enable business practices “provides a potential means of compromise to malicious cyber actors,” warned researchers.

The FBI, for instance, in April warned that threat actors are taking advantage of efforts to procure PPE and critical equipment such as ventilators, with new business email compromise (BEC) and other scams aimed at defrauding those seeking the supplies."

Google TAG researchers warn that APTs are targeting campaign staffers for both Donald Trump and Joe Biden with phishing emails.

With the U.S. presidential election months away, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are targeting the campaign staffers of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden in recent phishing attacks.

On Thursday, Shane Huntley with Google’s Threat Analysis Group said on Twitter that two separate phishing campaigns were recently detected. A China-linked APT group targeted Biden’s campaign staff, while an Iran-linked APT targeted Trump’s.

A Google spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Threatpost that in both incidents, the attackers took aim at staffers’ personal emails, and there was no evidence that the attempts were successful.



“We sent the targeted users our standard government-backed attack warning and we referred this information to federal law enforcement,” the spokesperson told Threatpost. “We encourage campaign staff to use extra protection for their work and personal emails.”

Huntley said that the APT targeting Biden’s campaign staff was APT 31 (also known as Zirconium). According to reports, this threat actor is tied to the Chinese government — however,  little is known about its tactics and techniques.

Huntley pointed to APT 35 (also known as Charming Kitten) as the group targeting Trump’s campaign staff. The Iran-linked hacking group has been known to use phishing as an attack vector, and in February was discovered targeting public figures in phishing attacks that stole victims’ email-account information. Earlier this year, Microsoft also took control of 99 websites utilized by APT 35 in attacks.

No further information regarding the timeline, scale and lures involved in the campaign phishing emails was shared by Google.

The impacts of a successful phishing attack against presidential campaign staffers could be particularly dangerous as the Nov. 3 elections draw closer, security experts told Threatpost.

“As we have seen in recent history, APT groups targeting political campaigns is nothing new,” Charles Ragland, security engineer at Digital Shadows, told Threatpost. “These groups may be looking to use information that they obtain to sow discord in the country of the ongoing campaign. They may also use it for more traditional intelligence collection to inform other actions. As more and more communication is done online, this trend is likely to continue.”

Election campaigns are a hot spot for cybercriminals looking for these types of information. Last year, a group of hackers tied to Iran attempted to break into accounts associated with the 2020 reelection campaign of President Trump. Researchers from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center associated the activity with a group called Phosphorus.

“Mobile phishing has increased as an approach of malicious actors to steal user credentials by tricking users into entering those credentials into fake cloud services portal used by political campaigns,” Chris Hazelton, director of Security Solutions at Lookout, told Threatpost. “There has been a significant increase in mobile phishing attacks among political campaigns.”"

Increase of 37 percent from Q4 2019 to Q1 2020 attributed to creation of remote workforce due to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.

The rate of mobile phishing rose sharply between the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, a boost most likely due to the increased number of people working from home due to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, new research has found.

In fact, encounter rates for enterprise mobile phishing increased 37 percent between the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, from around 16 percent to 22 percent.

The Mobile Phishing Spotlight Report from Lookout highlights how threat actors have shifted their tactics to take advantage of the evolving move from the physical to mobile or home office in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many companies to order their employees to work from home and use mobile devices as part of their every-day productivity.



“Workers are no longer within the protective perimeter of their office-based security controls,” wrote Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at Lookout in a blog post about the research. “In short, remote work has created a prime opportunity for cybercriminals to expand their phishing attacks.”

As this trend will likely continue for the foreseeable future — with large corporations such as Google, Twitter, Facebook and Amazon keeping their workforce remote until all shelter-in-place regulations are lifted — organizations may have to shift their security tactics and education of employees to keep up with the evolving threat, he said.

“With this new reality, organizations need to ensure they are prepared,” Schless wrote.

Indeed, phishing in general has been an attack of choice for threat actors during the pandemic, with attackers widely using socially-engineered email lures to get victims to download infostealers and other types of malware. At one point cyberattackers were sending 1.5 million malicious emails per day related to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers found.

Mobile phishing attacks, however, are different from typical phishing campaigns that target workstations and laptops in several ways. For one thing, they don’t always come in the form of emails, Schless noted. The mobile platform gives attackers a wider playing field with which to work and deliver malicious links for installing malware: They can use SMS, social media, messaging platforms and even dating apps to deliver malicious payloads via phishing attacks on mobile devices, he said.

Another difference is that people tend to use (as well as trust) their mobile devices more, as they “sit at the intersection of their owners’ personal and professional identity,” Schless wrote. This might make them less attentive to the possibility of receiving attacks on this interface.

Users also might not notice a malicious link on a mobile device due to the use of “a smaller screen and simplified user interface,” he added.

In addition to educating employees on the higher potential for mobile-phishing attacks now that they are working remotely, organizations should consider other strategies to protect workers from mobile-phishing attacks.

At the top of this list would be to implement security infrastructure and protocols that consider the mobile workplace as a similar entity to an enterprise scenario in which employees are located in one physical location, Schless suggested. Indeed, bolstering cloud-based security measures to protect a dispersed workforce as completely as an on-premise enterprise security solution would is an important aspect of combatting new mobile phishing threats, he said.

“[It’s] imperative that organizations adopt a comprehensive mobile security solution that is built for a cloud-enabled mobile-first world,” Schless wrote."
Email Phishing,"Clever Phishing Attack Bypasses MFA to Nab Microsoft Office 365 Credentials

The attack discovered by Cofense can steal sensitive user data stored on the cloud as well as find other victims to target.

A new phishing campaign can bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) on Office 365 to access victims’ data stored on the cloud and use it to extort a Bitcoin ransom or even find new victims to target, security researchers have found.

Researchers at Cofense Phishing Defense Center discovered the tactic, which leverages the OAuth2 framework and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol and uses a malicious SharePoint link to trick users into granting permissions to a rogue application, researcher Elmer Hernandez wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.

The attack is different than a typical credential harvester in that it attempts to trick users into granting permissions to the application, which can bypass MFA, he said. MFA is used as back-up security to a user’s password in case the password is compromised and is meant to protect an account in such a scenario.



“This is not the first time the tactic has been observed, but it’s a stark reminder that phishing isn’t going to be solved by multi-factor authentication,” Hernandez noted.

If attackers are successful, they can engage in a number of threat behaviors, researchers said. The most basic attack can steal all the victims’ email and access cloud hosted documents containing sensitive or confidential information. But attackers wouldn’t have to stop there, he said.

“Once the attacker has sensitive information, they can use it to extort victims for a Bitcoin ransom,” Hernandez wrote. “The same permissions can also be used to download the user’s contact list to be used against fresh victims. Using the address book and old emails would allow the attacker to create hyper-realistic Reply-Chain phishing emails.”

The email used in the attack appears like a typical invite to a SharePoint hosted file; in the example cited in the research, the file seemed to be offering information about a salary bonus, creating an effective lure, Hernandez noted.

After clicking on the link, users are taken to the legitimate Microsoft Office 365 login page at https://login.microsoftonline.com. However, a closer inspection of the full, long-form URL showed that there are clues to its nefarious intentions that someone without technical experience might not notice, but which are more obvious to security experts.

Applications that want to access Office 356 data on behalf of a user do so through Microsoft Graph authorizations, but must first obtain an access token from the Microsoft Identity Platform, Hernandez explained.

“This is where OAuth2 and OIDC come in,” he said. “The latter is used to authenticate the user who will be granting the access, and if authentication is successful, the former authorizes (delegates) access for the application. All of this is done without exposing any credentials to the application.”

The entire URL used in the attack includes key parameters that show how the attacker can trick a victim into giving a rogue application permissions to access his or her account.

A parameter called “response_type” denotes the type of access being requested to the Microsoft Identity Platform /authorize endpoint. In the case of the attack examined by Hernandez, both an ID token and an authorization code (id_token+code) are requested.

“The latter will be exchanged for an access token which will, in turn, be presented by the application to Microsoft Graph for data access,” he explained.

In the next phase, the “redirect uri” parameter indicates the location to which authorization responses are sent, including tokens and authorization codes. In the attack outlined in the post, responses are sent to hxxps://officehnoc[.]com/office, a domain masquerading as a legitimate Office 365 entity. The domain’s location is 88[.]80[.]148[.]31 in Sofia, Bulgaria, where it is hosted by BelCloud, Hernandez noted.

Then, the “scope” parameter shows a list of permissions the user gives to the application that allow the application to read and/or modify specific resources for the signed-in user. If this parameter shows an “all” constraint, these permissions apply for all such resources in a directory, Hernandez said. Attackers also can ask for specific permissions using this parameter, he noted.

“For example “contacts.read” enables the application to read only the user’s contacts, whereas “notes.read.all” allows it to read all OneNote notebooks the user has access to, and “Files.ReadWrite.All” to both read and modify (create, update and delete) all files accessible to the user, not only his or her own,” he wrote.

The last and “most concerning” parameter that Hernandez identified in the extended URL  is “offline_access,” he explained, which allows the application to obtain refresh tokens that can be exchanged for new access tokens once they expire. This would allow an attacker to need only to authenticate and approve permissions once to potentially enable indefinite access to a victim’s data, he explained.

In the final step of the attack OpenID and profile parameters come into play, used to provide user authentication and profile information–such as the user’s name, profile picture, gender and locale among others. “This information, known as claims, is sent to the application in the ID token issued by the /authorize endpoint,” Hernandez wrote.

If a user falls for the malicious SharePoint link and signs in, he or she then will be asked to confirm one last time that he or she wants to grant the application the aforementioned permissions.

“If users fail to act, it will be up to domain administrators to spot and deal with any suspicious applications their users might have misguidedly approved,” Hernandez noted.

Hernandez said that the novel phishing campaign is evidence of attackers adapting and finding new ways to steal people’s credentials and use it for foul play, creating scenarios in which they can trick victims into working against themselves.

“Not only is there no need to compromise credentials, but touted security measures such as MFA are also bypassed; it is users themselves who unwittingly approve malicious access to their data,” he noted."

Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the Google name and the cloud to convince victims into handing over their login details.

A series of phishing campaigns using Google Firebase storage URLs have surfaced, showing that cybercriminals continue to leverage the reputation of Google’s cloud infrastructure to dupe victims and skate by secure email gateways.

Google Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform. Firebase Storage meanwhile provides secure file uploads and downloads for Firebase apps. Using the Firebase storage API, companies can store data in a Google cloud storage bucket.

The phishing effort starts with spam emails that encourage recipients to click on a Firebase link inside the email in order to visit promised content, according to Trustwave researcher Fahim Abbasi, writing in an analysis released Thursday. If the targets click on the link, they’re taken to a supposed login page (mainly for Office 365, Outlook or banking apps) and prompted to enter their credentials – which of course are sent directly to the cybercriminals.



“Credential phishing is a real threat targeting corporates globally,” noted Abbasi. “Threat actors are finding smart and innovative ways to lure victims to covertly harvest their corporate credentials. Threat actors then use these credentials to get a foothold into an organization to further their malicious agendas.”

In this case, that “innovative way” is using the Firebase link.

“Since it’s using Google Cloud Storage, credential-capturing webpages hosted on the service are more likely to make it through security protections like Secure Email Gateways due to the reputation of Google and the large base of valid users,” Karl Sigler, senior security research manager, SpiderLabs at Trustwave., told Threatpost. “The use of cloud infrastructure is rising among cybercriminals in order to capitalize on the reputation and valid uses of those services. They tend to not be immediately flagged by security controls just due to the URL.”

The campaigns were circulating globally, across a range of industries, but the majority of the “hits” have been in Europe and Australia, Sigler said.

“Most of the emails we saw were from late March through the middle of April, but we’ve seen samples as a part of this campaign as far back as February and as recently as mid-May,” he added. “While these tactics of piggy-backing on valid cloud services likely go back to the days those services were invented, this is a current and active trend.” 

Major themes for the lures include payment invoices, exhortations to upgrade email accounts, prompts to release pending messages, urging recipients to verify accounts, warnings of account errors, change-password emails and more. In one case, “scammers used the Covid-19 pandemic and internet banking as an excuse to lure the victims into clicking on the fake vendor payment form that leads to the phishing page hosted on Firebase Storage,” according to the analysis.

Overall, the phishing messages are convincing, according to Trustwave, with only subtle imperfections that might tip off potential victims that there’s something wrong, such as a few poor graphics.

“Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their techniques and tools to covertly deliver their messages to unwitting victims,” Abbasi said. “In this campaign, threat actors leverage the reputation and service of the Google Cloud infrastructure to conduct phishing by embedding Google firebase storage URLs in phishing emails.”

Using Google to lend an air of legitimacy is an ongoing trend. Earlier this year, an attack surfaced that uses homographic characters to impersonate Google domain names and launch convincing but malicious websites. And last August, a targeted spearphishing campaign hit an organization in the energy sector – after using Google Drive to get around the company’s Microsoft email security stack. The campaign impersonated the CEO of the targeted company, sending email via Google Drive purporting to be “sharing an important message” with the recipients.

“Again, because of the valid uses and large user base of these services, many of these phishing emails can slip through the cracks of the security controls we put in place,” Sigler added. “Educating users about these tactics helps provide defense-in-depth against these techniques when they hit a victim’s inbox.”"
Whaling,"Spear-Phishing Attack Spoofs EE To Target Executives

Researchers say spear-phishing emails purporting to be from telecom giant EE are being sent to top corporate execs.

Researchers warn of an ongoing spear-phishing attack mimicking a well-known telecommunications company, EE, to snatch up corporate executives’ credentials and payment details.

Highly targeted emails have been sent to a few executives – including one at a leading financial firm – purporting to be from British internet service provider EE, which as of 2019 is one the largest mobile network operators in the UK, with around 32 million customers.

The phishing campaign comes with a few sloppy red flags that eagle-eyed recipients might pick up on – but researchers say its use of HTTPS and SSL certificates for its landing page help it evade detection.



“This new, targeted campaign shows that while exploiting well-known telecommunications brands is nothing new, such phishing emails continue to go undetected by popular email gateways designed to protect end users, leading to possible theft of prized corporate credentials,” said researchers with Cofense in a Monday analysis.

The emails bear a subject line reading “View Bill – Error” that comes from a purchased, top-level domain (moniquemoll[.]nl). Therein lies the first red flag: EE’s trademarked name isn’t included in any part of the full email address.

Another red flag is the content of the email, which remains strangely vague, only saying “we’re working to get this fixed,” without going the step further to indicate what the actual error is. Also, the threat actor includes an incorrect registered office address (at the bottom of the email).

The email tells recipients that “the best way to update details is to log on to your EE” and offers a hyperlink that states ‘view billing to make sure your account details are correct’ to entice the recipient to click the phishing link.

If a user clicks one of the links, they are redirected to a phishing page. The phishing landing page uses the trusted HTTPS protocol (also displayed as the green padlock) within the URL. The use of HTTPS, which other phishing campaigns have utilized, gives false hope to the user that network traffic is being encrypted and that it’s therefore safe. However, just because the traffic is encrypted, does not mean that a website isn’t malicious.

The attackers went a step further by obtaining SSL certificates for the phishing landing page’s domain to further add an air of legitimacy. Researchers said, it has become much easier for site owners, including fraudsters, to obtain these certificates. The initial phishing landing page then asks for victims to log in to their EE (formerly Everything Everywhere) accounts. They are then taken to a page requesting their payment information.

“The peculiar aspect is the message in which the threat actor included: ‘You will not be charged’ to reassure recipients and trick them into providing their payment information,” said researchers.

spear phishing EE campaign

The user is then automatically redirected to the legitimate EE website to avoid suspicion. This is a common tactic to make the user believe the session timed out or their password was mistyped, researchers said. Researchers said the phishing pages are still live and active as of Monday.

Phishing campaigns continue to target online users over the past month, particularly with the new troves of remote workers. Earlier in April, several U.S. universities were targeted in a widespread spear-phishing attack that uses adult dating as a lure. Also in April, threat actors continued to capitalize on fears surrounding the spread of the COVID-19 virus through a surge in new phishing campaigns that use spoofing tactics to effectively evade Proofpoint and Microsoft Office 365 advanced threat protections (ATPs), researchers have found."
Spear phishing,"Microsoft Sway Abused in Office 365 Phishing Attack

The “PerSwaysion” attackers have leveraged a plethora of Microsoft services to compromise at least 150 executives in a highly targeted phishing campaign.

A highly targeted phishing campaign, with a Microsoft file platform twist, has successfully siphoned the Office 365 credentials of more than 150 executives since mid-2019.

Researchers attribute the campaign’s success to two parts: First, it leverages multiple Microsoft file-sharing services to convince victims to hand over their credentials. That includes Microsoft’s Sway platform used for newsletters and presentations (its use of Sway, in fact, inspired researchers to name the campaign “PerSwaysion”), as well as the SharePoint and OneNote collaboration platforms. Second, the initial phishing emails are sent from legitimate but previously compromised email addresses — which cloak the fact that they’re attacker-controlled.

Multiple threat groups are working together to carry out PerSwaysion, according to researchers.

“PerSwaysion campaign is yet another living example of highly specialized phishing threat actors working together to conduct effective attacks on a large scale,” said Feixiang He, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB in a Thursday analysis.” The campaign phishing kit is primarily developed by a group of Vietnamese-speaking malware developers, while campaign proliferation and hacking activities are operated by other independent groups of scammers.”



The ongoing PerSwaysion campaign has targeted small- and medium-sized financial services companies, law firms and real estate groups across the U.S., Canada, Germany, the U.K. and other countries. Its impact is serious: Access to executives’ Office 365 accounts gives attackers a full range of top-level, sensitive corporate data, as well as the ability to launch subsequent phishing attacks on other high-profile targets.

The Campaign
Researchers first discovered PerSwaysion after inspecting a phishing email that came from an external business partner of the victim. While the initial email had some small red flags (strange typos in the body of the email, for example), the sender used a legitimate email address of the victim’s actual partner.

The email read, “Please+see+above+document+from[redacted] for your review and let me know if you have any concerns.” The document being referenced is a PDF file attachment, which pretends to be a notification for Office 365 file sharing. The “notification” includes the full name, email address and sender’s company to add an air of legitimacy – -however, researchers noted that it also contains glitchy, random strings (likely bugs in the automation software used by scammers to generate the PDF files).

If victims click on the link, its then sends them to yet another file pretending to be associated with Office 365, this one hosted on Microsoft Sway’s platform.

“For untrained eyes, this page resembles an authentic Microsoft Office 365 file-sharing page,” said researchers. “However, this is a specially crafted presentation page which abuses Sway’s default borderless view to trick the victim [into thinking it was] part of the Office 365 official login page.”

microsoft phishing campaignThe page tells the recipient that the sender has shared a document on behalf of the company, and again asks the target to click on a button to “Get Started.” Finally, this last link redirects the victim to the actual phishing landing page, which purports to be a Microsoft Single Sign On (SSO) page for Outlook, and asks the victim to input their credentials. This SSO page actually appears to be part of a phishing kit that’s been re-used over a long period of time — the kit developer copied a version of Microsoft’s Outlook login page from 2017.

“When the victim submits his or her corporate Office 365 credentials as if for a normal login, the sensitive data is sent to a separate data server with an extra email address which is hidden on the page,” said researchers. “This extra email seems to be used as a real-time notification method to make sure scammers react on freshly harvested credentials.”

Different attack variants swap in other file-sharing platforms, including Microsoft SharePoint and OneNote. By going to such lengths in using Microsoft’s services, “the scammers pick legit file-sharing services which have the ability of rendering seamless preview of uploaded files with phishing links,” researchers noted. “This key feature helps scammers construct web pages that strongly resemble authentic Microsoft experience.”

Follow Up Operations
After swiping victims’ credentials, the attackers then rinse and repeat the attack by targeting victims’ email correspondents.

microsoft phishing campaign

After logging into victim email accounts to double-check that they’re valid, they then access the victims’ corporate email server and dump their email data. Then, the attackers generate new phishing PDF files using the victims’ full names, email addresses, company legal names and sometimes victims’ official titles. These PDFs are then sent to users who victims have interacted with recently.

“These PDF files are sent to a selection of new people who have recent email communications with the current victim,” said researchers. “It’s of note that PerSwaysion scammers typically delete impersonating emails from the victim’s outbox to avoid suspicion.”"

More than 150,000 emails spreading the Hupigon RAT that use adult dating as a lure have been uncovered, with almost half being sent to U.S. university and college email addresses.

Several U.S. universities have been targeted in a widespread spear-phishing attack that uses adult dating as a lure. In reality, the emails spread the Hupigon remote access trojan (RAT), known to be leveraged by state-sponsored threat actors.

Researchers from Proofpoint warned that the ongoing spear-phishing campaign has sent more than 150,000 messages to 60+ different industries – with almost half of the malicious emails focused on the education space, including several unnamed colleges and universities. The bulk of the messages (80,000 emails) were mostly sent between April 14 and 15.

The emails use an adult dating lure, sending the victim two pictures of women and requesting the recipient to choose one to connect with by clicking the link under the picture. After the recipient clicks the link, an executable download begins (the file is named “sex_Live1.5.0.1099.exe”) that then installs the Hupigon RAT onto the system.



The Hupigon RAT, which has been active since at least 2006, has various data exfiltration features and capabilities and has been previously utilized by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. It gives attackers rootkit functionality, webcam monitoring capabilities, and the ability to log keystrokes and steal passwords.

us university spear phishing attack“In this case, cybercriminals repurposed a nearly 15-year-old attack tool leveraged by state-sponsored threat actors, among others. We believe this campaign is crimeware-motivated,” said Proofpoint researchers, in an analysis last week. “Proofpoint associates Hupigon with historic APT campaigns based on the language of the builder, open-source breach reporting and multiple reports of similar APT actor behaviors between 2010 and 2012.”

Other details remain scant about the campaign, other than the fact that the payload makes a DNS request to eth[.]ceo located at 142.54.162[.]66 for the initial command-and-control (C2) communication. Researchers also noted that the domain used for delivery, down.gogominer[.]com, is hosted on the same address space as the C2, 142.54.162[.]67.

Threatpost has reached out to Proofpoint for more information about the campaign, including any evidence of whether APT groups are behind this particular attack.

us university adult dating lure

The attacks come as universities and colleges face unprecedented remote-work security issues, after having to send students home and set up courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Previously uncovered malware campaigns have targeted the healthcare and education industries, including one targeting a Canadian medical research university. Other schools have been hit by Zoom-bombing attacks, where attackers hijack online classes using the Zoom platform to spew hateful messages or videos.

Universities were targeted even before the ongoing pandemic forced them to move coursework online: In September 2019, a massive campaign was uncovered involving at least 20 new phishing domains, targeting more than 60 universities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The campaign, bent on lifting credentials from students heading back to school, was associated with a group of Iranian cyberattackers collectively known as Cobalt Dickens or Silent Librarian."
Email Phishing,"Skype Phishing Attack Targets Remote Workers’ Passwords

Attackers are sending convincing emails that ultimately steal victims’ Skype credentials.

Remote workers are being warned of a new phishing campaign targeting their Skype passwords.

The phishing emails look “eerily similar” to a legitimate Skype notification alert, according to a report released by Cofense on Thursday. Emails indicate users have 13 pending Skype notifications that can be checked by clicking a “Review” button.


“It is not uncommon to receive emails about pending notifications for various services,” researchers wrote. “The threat actor anticipates users will recognize this as just that, so they take action to view the notifications. Curiosity and the sense of urgency entice many users to click the ‘Review’ button without recognizing the obvious signs of a phishing attack.”

Those red flags are apparent upon closer inspection. The sender address, which spoofs a convincing Skype phone number and email address in the sender address, appears legitimate at first glance. But the real email address – an external, compromised account – can be found in the return-path (displayed as “sent from”).

Upon clicking “Review,” users are redirected through an app.link (hxxps://jhqvy[.]app[.]link/VAMhgP3Mi5) and finally to the end landing page (hxxps://skype-online0345[.]web[.]app).

The .app top level domain, used for this phishing landing page, is backed by Google to help app developers securely share their apps. It adds an air of further legitimacy to the phishing attack, researchers said.

“A benefit of this top-level domain is that it requires HTTPS to connect to it, adding security on both the user’s and developer’s end, which is great…but not in this case,” said researchers. “The inclusion of HTTPS means the addition of a lock to the address bar, which most users have been trained to trust. Because this phishing site is being hosted via Google’s .app TLD it displays this trusted icon.”

The webpage impersonates a legitimate Skype login page, asking for victims’ Skype credentials. The threat actors have done their research – they’ve added recipients’ company logos to the login box, as well as a disclaimer at the bottom warning that the page is for “authorized use” of that company’s users only.

The username is also auto-filled (due to the URL containing the base64 of the target email address) – another trick that leaves little room for doubt on the victims’ side.

“The only thing left for the user to do is to enter his or her password, which then falls into the hands of the threat actor,” said researchers.

Skype phishing email

The campaign is one of many looking to leverage the wave of remote workers who, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic have come to rely on online conferencing tools like Webex (as well as Zoom and other platforms). With this upward spike in online meetings, compromised Skype credentials could be sold on underground forums, or used to log into accounts where sensitive files and data are shared (among other malicious activities).

Earlier in April, a phishing campaign was unearthed reeling in victims with a recycled Cisco security advisory that warns of a critical vulnerability. The campaign urges victims to “update,” only to steal their credentials for Cisco’s Webex web conferencing platform instead.

Researchers warn users to stay on the lookout for bad actors spoofing web conferencing and virtual collaboration apps. In general, attackers are taking advantage of the panic around the coronavirus with phishing emails around financial relief, promises of a cure and symptom information details.

“With so many people working from home, remote work software like Skype, Slack, Zoom, and WebEx are starting to become popular themes of phishing lures,” said Cofense researchers."

Emails purporting to be a Cisco “critical security advisory” are actually part of a phishing campaign trying to steal victims’ Webex credentials.

An ongoing phishing campaign is reeling in victims with a recycled Cisco security advisory that warns of a critical vulnerability. The campaign urges victims to “update,” only to steal their credentials for Cisco’s Webex web conferencing platform instead.

The campaign is looking to leverage the wave of remote workers who, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic have come to rely on online conferencing tools like Webex (as well as Zoom and other platforms). With this upward spike in online meetings, compromised Webex credentials could be a cybercriminal’s golden ticket into web conference calls where sensitive files and data are shared (among other malicious activities).

“Targeting users of teleconferencing brands is nothing new,” said Ashley Tran with Cofense’s phishing defense center, in a Thursday analysis. “But with most organizations adhering to guidelines that non-essential workers stay home, the rapid influx of remote workers is prime picking for attackers trying to spoof brands like WebEx. We anticipate there will continue be an increase in remote work phishing in the months to come.”


Researchers said the phishing emails are being sent with various attention-grabbing subject lines, such as “Critical Update” or “Alert!” and come from the spoofed email address, “meetings@webex[.]com”.

Researchers told Threatpost, this was a mass “spray and pray” phishing campaign with “numerous end users” receiving and reporting the email from several several industries, including the healthcare and financial spaces.

“With the subject and mail content combined, this may [engage] users’ curiosity enough to entice them click in order to take the requested action,” said Tran.

The body of the email embeds content from a real Cisco Security Advisory from December 2016, along with Cisco Webex branding. The advisory is for CVE-2016-9223, a legitimate vulnerability in CloudCenter Orchestrator Docker Engine, which is Cisco’s management tool for applications in multiple data-center, private-cloud and public-cloud environments. This critical flaw allowed unauthenticated, remote attackers to install Docker containers with high privileges on affected systems; at the time of disclosure in 2016, it was being exploited in the wild. However, the vulnerability was fixed in the Cisco CloudCenter Orchestrator 4.6.2 patch release (also in 2016).

cisco Webex phishing campaign 

“In this scenario, the threat actor has spoofed a legitimate business service and explained a problem with their software, prompting even non-technical readers to read further,” said the Confense researcher. “The threat actor even links to a legitimate write-up for the vulnerability, found at the URL embedded into the text ‘CVE-2016-9223.'”

The email tells victims, “To fix this error, we recommend that you update the version of Cisco Meetings Desktop App for Windows” and points them to a “Join” button to learn more about the “update.”

The attackers behind this campaign appear to be meticulous in the details, right down to the URL linked to the “Join” button. If more cautious email recipients hover over the button to check the URL, they’ll find the URL [hxxps://globalpagee-prod-webex[.]com/signin] to be strikingly similar to the legitimate Cisco WebEx URL [hxxps://globalpage-prod[.]webex[.]com/signin].

The Landing Page

Victims who click on the “Join” button are redirected to the phishing landing page, which is identical to the legitimate Cisco WebEx login page. Researchers said one small difference is that when email addresses are typed into the legitimate Webex page, entries are checked to verify if there are associated accounts. On the phishing page, meanwhile, any email format entry takes the recipient directly to the next page to request their password.

The threat actor registered the fraudulent domain tied to the landing page through the Public Domain Registry just days before sending out the phishing emails. The fraudulent domain was still live and active as of Wednesday, researchers said.

cisco Webex phishing campaign 

“The attacker has even gone as far as obtaining a SSL certificate for their fraudulent domain to gain further trust from end users,” researchers said. “While the official Cisco certificate is verified by HydrantID, the attacker’s certificate is through Sectigo Limited. Regardless of who verified the attacker’s certificate, the result is the same – a lock to the left of its URL that renders the email legitimate the eyes of many users.”

Researchers warn users to stay on the lookout for bad actors spoofing web conferencing and virtual collaboration apps. In general, attackers are taking advantage of the panic around the coronavirus with phishing emails around financial relief, promises of a cure and symptom information details."
Email Phishing,"In COVID-19 Scam Scramble, Cybercrooks Recycle Phishing Kits

Old phishing kits are being pressed into service to keep up with the unprecedented volume of new scams that exploit the pandemic.

Phishing attacks looking to take advantage of interest and fear around the COVID-19 health crisis are becoming a pandemic themselves – and apparently cybercriminals are looking to conserve resources by leaning on their older stockpiles of weapons to keep the infection wave going.

Or Katz, a researcher at Akamai, said in a posting on Thursday that older phishing kits that were previously deployed and then retired are being pressed back into service in order to target those working from home. In fact, Akamai researchers have seen recycled phishing kits from as far back as July being used in coronavirus-based phishing attacks now.

Millions of Americans are telecommuting due to self-isolation, mandated quarantine or corporate policies as coronavirus infections continue to spike. Akamai’s team, like many others in the security community, has recently observed phishing attacks that start with SMS messages or emails that direct victims to domains “seemingly related to COVID-19 news, governmental updates, or health-related products and services.”



In the latest attacks, which have been seen globally, victims that click the link are directed to one domain and then immediately redirected to yet another. The second domain spoofs big brands like Microsoft, Orange France and eBay, or health resources such as the World Health Organization or local medical experts.

“By pretending to be an insurance company, bank, medical expert or other trusted brand, criminals are convincing victims to trust them,” Katz wrote. “Once trust is established, the criminal is betting on the victim doing as asked, by opening malicious attachments, following malicious links, and releasing sensitive personal information, in order to enable access to critical applications and services.”

While most of these URLs are new (Katz said that dozens of new coronavirus-based domains are being deployed each day), the phishing kits that operate in the background are not.

In February, just 19 domains using one of the phishing kits in circulation were reused tools. In contrast, in March, 43 of them were recycled – a much higher rate than any of the 15 months previous. And already, in just the first two days of April, a full 26 domains using one of the in-use kits are old weapons.

“The recycling and repurposing of phishing kits themselves are indicative of the turnkey, industrial nature of the phishing industry,” Katz said. The upside however is that the known fingerprint of the older kits makes defenders’ jobs a bit easier, in theory.

COVID-19 Dominates the Cybercrime Scene

The novel coronavirus (and the COVID-19 disease that it causes) has emerged as primary cybercrime theme in the last few weeks as the pandemic takes hold globally.

Just this week for instance, Nokia’s Threat Intelligence Lab has analyzed new campaigns that include a trojan targeting Windows that mimics a real map of confirmed COVID-19 cases (and then steals user data); and the CovidLock Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients. Instead, the app locks the device and asks the user to pay $250 in ransom via Bitcoin. Nokia also spotted an Android coronavirus safety-mask SMS scam – an app pretending to help users find safety masks, while in reality stealing contacts and SMS messages.

The banking trojan known as Zeus Sphinx meanwhile was recently spotted joining the growing fray of COVID-19-themed phishing and malspam campaigns, using a government-assistance lure.

And, cybercriminals are now hijacking routers and changing Domain Name System (DNS) settings, in order to redirect victims to attacker controlled sites promoting fake coronavirus information apps. If victims download these apps, they are infected with information-stealing Oski malware.

To boot, Cisco has been monitoring adversary activity and has seen a surge in Internet requests to domains that include the over the past two months. Cisco Talos recently stated that it has observed a significant increase in phishing attacks leveraging COVID 19, as well as recent economic stimulus information from the US Government

Also notable: The Cisco Umbrella product team on Wednesday released telemetry numbers on malicious domains related to the keywords “covid” and “corona” – it found that enterprise customers made 562,144 queries to 8,080 unique domains containing these keywords in mid-February. A month later, in March, the company saw a whopping 1,907% increase in requests to such sites, across 47,059 domains containing the keywords. Out of those, 4 percent (1,882 of them) were blocked as malicious sites.

“Criminals have started spreading ransomware and other malware via [coronavirus-themed] email, SMS messages and malicious apps,” Katz wrote. “Others are running scam stores and offering to sell COVID-19 testing kits and related medical supplies. As people transition away from office life to a work-from-home program, criminals recognize that such situations create valuable attack surfaces and are working to take advantage.”"

A spate of phishing attacks have promised financial relief due to the coronavirus pandemic – but in reality swiped victims’ credentials, payment card data and more.

Researchers are warning of an upward surge in social-engineering lures in malicious emails that promise victims financial relief during the coronavirus pandemic.

The slew of campaigns piggy-back on news of governments mulling financial relief packages, in response to the economic stall brought on by consumers social distance themselves. This latest trend shows cybercriminals continuing to look to the newest developments in the coronavirus saga as leverage for phishing campaigns, targeted emails spreading malware and more.

“These campaigns use the promise of payments by global governments and businesses (specifically financial institutions) aimed at easing the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic to urge users to click links or download files,” said Proofpoint researchers, in analysis released Wednesday.


One credential-phishing campaign has been spotted primarily targeting U.S. healthcare and higher-education organizations (as well as the technology industry, including information-security companies), with a message purporting to be from their payroll departments.

The emails, titled “General Payroll !” explain that the Trump administration “is considering” sending most American adults a check to help stimulate the economy.

coronavirus phishing attack“The Trump administration is considering sending most American adults a check for $1,000 as part of the efforts to stimulate the economy and help workers whose jobs have been disrupted by business closures because of the pandemic,” says the message. “All staff/faculty & employee include student are expected to verify their email account for new payroll directory and adjustment for the month of March benefit payment.”

Researchers said that these emails come with plenty of red flags, including their “crude design,” with clear grammatical and spelling errors as can be seen above. The messages also use a basic web page that’s clearly branded by a free website maker for its phishing landing page.

The message asks recipients to verify their email accounts through a malicious link (called the “MARCH-BENEFIT secure link”) that directs them to a phishing page. This phishing page then asks for their usernames, email addresses and passwords tied to their employee benefits.

coronavirus phishing attack

Researchers pointed to similar phishing campaigns in Australia and the U.K. In Australia, a campaign was discovered using emails claiming to be from a major Australian newspaper and using the subject line, “Government announces increased tax benefits in response to the coronavirus.” These email messages contain a PDF attachment with an embedded URL that leads to a phishing page, where victims are asked to input their Microsoft OneDrive credentials.

In the U.K., a large email campaign was uncovered targeting manufacturing, technology, transportation, healthcare, aerospace, retail, energy, technology, business services and hospitality companies. The campaign emails claim to be from a major (unnamed) United Kingdom bank. It offers 300 Singapore dollars (approximately $210 USD) as financial support, and tells the recipient to “Start Here” to claim the money by clicking on a link. That then leads them to the attacker-controlled landing page that asks for their name, address and credit-card number.

coronavirus phishing attackAnother, smaller campaign targets technology and IT organizations, purporting to be from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These emails, sent with a subject line of “COVID 19 : Relief Compensation,” tells recipients they have been “randomly selected to be compensated financially due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 Epidemic outbreak” and asks them to learn more by clicking on an fake Microsoft Excel-branded attachment that gathers emails and passwords.

Attackers continue to leverage coronavirus-themed cyberattacks as panic around the global pandemic continues – including malware attacks, booby-trapped URLs and credential-stuffing scams. Researchers warned that users should continue to be on the lookout for phishing emails playing into fears around the coronavirus pandemic.

Zeus Sphinx for instance was recently spotted joining the growing fray of COVID-19-themed phishing and malspam campaigns, using a government-assistance lure.

“The ongoing shift to coronavirus-themed messages and campaigns is truly social engineering at scale, and these recent payment-related lures underscore that threat actors are paying attention to new developments,” researchers said. “We anticipate threat actors will continue modifying their strategies as the news surrounding COVID-19 shifts.”"

About 10 compromised websites employ a multi-stage, targeted effort to fingerprint and compromise victims.

An extensive campaign has surfaced that targets Windows users belonging to a specific Asian religious and ethnic group. The attack making use of a series of watering-hole websites and a drive-by download gambit relying on fake Flash updates.

According to analysis from Kaspersky, released on Tuesday, the websites in question are legitimate sites that were compromised to selectively trigger a drive-by download attack. There are almost 10 compromised websites in all, researchers said, belonging to high-profile personalities within the target group, public bodies, charities and other organizations. The security firm said that some of the sites (all hosted on the same server) are still compromised, and continue to carry out the campaign.

While the Uighurs – an ethnic and religious minority in China – have been the targets of multiple cyberattacks and surveillance in the past, the firm said that it couldn’t reveal the identity of the target group.



“Unfortunately, at this moment we cannot share anything in addition to what has been shared already,” the Kaspersky research team told Threatpost, via email. “We are ready to share relevant the information we have on those attacks with any group/organization that feels it may become a target of this campaign, and that we’ve also been hard at work trying to contact the victims we know of.”

Looking under the hood, the effort (which Kaspersky said has been active since at least May 2019) turns out to be a multi-stage affair that uses a variety of open-source development tools.

It kicks off with a first-stage JavaScript line of code that’s automatically served by the website, according to the analysis. It’s named (script|jquery)-css.js, and is obfuscated with the Chinese-language web service Sojson, version 4. Its job is to fingerprint visitors to the watering hole to see if they’re targets for the next stages of the attack – it collects target information and sends it via HTTP GET requests to a remote server, which returns a JSON-formatted response of either “true” or “false.”

If the answer is “true,” this triggers the loading of a second-stage JavaScript.

The second JavaScript stage is named (script|jquery)-file.js, and is obfuscated with Sojson version 5, according to the research. The purpose of this code is to surface a pop-up to website visitors that encourages them to download a supposed “update” for Flash player.

The purported update is actually a file hosted on a GitHub repository. If the website visitor falls for the fake prompt and clicks “install,” four different executables are downloaded to the victim’s machine.

Kaspersky said that these include an installer package that includes a decoy, legitimate Flash update and a stager. However, the Flash update is no longer valid, so it will fail with a message stating that the installer is outdated or renamed, and will direct the user to the Adobe website, according to the analysis.

The second file is a module called “Godlike12,” which is a backdoor written in the Go language that sets up a command-and-control (C2) channel and proceeds with host fingerprinting upon startup (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows version, current time, Kaspersky researchers wrote). It also regularly checks for a remote [ID]-cs.txt, which contains encrypted commands for it to carry out. The most interesting thing about the implant is the fact that it exchanges files with a Google Drive space in order to communicate.

And finally, there are two versions of the open-source Stitch Python backdoor that are installed, Kaspersky said. Stitch is a remote-shell program that establishes a direct socket connection with the C2 to exchange AES-encrypted data with the remote server; in this case though, both backdoors have been customized to add persistence, an auto-update function, and decoy download and execution capabilities.

“Threat actors wrapped Stitch with custom Python code to perform additional operations,” according to the Kaspersky write-up. “It downloads a legitimate Adobe Flash installation program from the C2 server at startup; it auto-updates the backdoor from ubntrooters.serveuser[.]com at startup; [and] it ensures persistence through schtasks [T1053] with a logon task named AdobeUpdater pointing to C:\ProgramData\package\AdobeService.exe.”

Taken in all, the operation appears to be under constant development – albeit of a not-that-sophisticated nature in the security firm’s estimation.

“The attackers have set up a sizable yet very targeted water-holing attack,” the researchers concluded. “The toolset that’s being used seems low-budget and not fully developed, but has been modified several times in a few months to leverage interesting features like Google Drive C2, and would be characteristic of a small, agile team.”

Though the team was unable to correlate the attacks to any known APT groups, the attackers could be of Chinese origin, Kaspersky noted. For one, the encryption function in the Go-language implant “seems to have been inspired from existing open-source code, which mainly appears popular in Chinese-language forums,” according to the research.

Also, “Source-file paths in the code suggest this backdoor may have been developed on a GNU/Linux system,” the analysis continued. “The not-so-common (less than 100 results in a popular search engine) /root/gowork GOPATH that some of this backdoor’s modules have been compiled from seems popular in Chinese-speaking communities, and may originate from a Chinese-authored tutorial on Go language."

Using homographic characters is an easy way to execute a convincing fake site.

An attack that uses homographic characters to impersonate domain names and launch convincing but malicious websites takes minutes and a bare modicum of skill — while reaping high rates of success in luring victims, according to an independent researcher.

Researcher Avi Lumelsky set out to see how easy it would be to set up a phishing page that used homographics to impersonate legitimate sites. As he explained in a posting this week, “homographic characters look like ASCII letters, but their encoding is different, in a way that is usually not noticeable for the human eye.”

As an example, this URL uses a homographic character as its first character: “ɢoogle.news.” That can be compared to the legitimate “google.news” font — there’s a barely discernable difference.



Lumelsky noted that a few years ago someone bought the homographic-including “ɢoogle.com” to use it for phishing purposes.

“I wondered to myself: There are new top-level-domains every year. Did the world learn from the ɢoogle.com acquisition? How hard is it to create a good Google phishing website from scratch?”

Setting out to find out, the researcher turned to the main domain registrars – GoDaddy, Namecheap and even Google Domains – to first see if he could snag appropriate URLs. He found the process to be so simple that a basic search resulted in a dozen suggestions for available domain names, including ɢoogle.company; ɢoogle.email; ɢoogle.tv; ɢoogle.life and even ɢoogletranslate.com, all for what Lumelsky said was a “great” price. He purchased a handful of them, using an obviously fake identity that included “Not Google :)” as the company name.

After that, he was able to set up a virtual private server in the cloud to host the domains; and he also requested a LetsEncrypt certificate to “safeguard” traffic to and from the sites – and get around security red flags from browsers. Chrome for instance showed the domains as “Secure” (with a lock icon) thanks to the certificate.

“Now, one can use https:// links to gain trust, while providing malicious content,” Lumelsky said.

The next step was routing the sites’ domain name server (DNS) traffic to the cloud server. DNS translates human-readable website names to machine addresses, which enables most internet interactions between sites, plugins and the like. He also set up a nginx proxy, masking the true destination of any request to the site’s DNS server. And to seal the deception, he also used Google’s JavaScript code from the legitimate site as the code for his own.

“The great thing about using a proxy is that my domain’s links previews, in every single platform, fetches Google Translate’s exact description while pointing to my link,” the researcher explained. “[Also,] Google’s JS runs normally from my domain.”



In all, Lumelsky said that it was a simple affair to set up a very convincing fake domain – it took minutes, with no coding, he explained. Further, “on mobile phones, the ‘ɢ’ in my domain looks like an actual ‘G,'” he said.

From there he completed his trial with some social-engineering forays that he said were successful in luring visitors to the sites, “with very little effort,” he said. He also posted links to the sites in security threads on Reddit and elsewhere to see if security-minded targets would notice the discrepancy in the domain name. That too was successful, he added.

“Eventually, without much work, I ended up with hundreds of unique visitors (excluding the bots and security scanners or the platforms in which I posted),” he explained. “It looks and acts just like any google single-page application.”

The next step in the proof-of-concept was to weaponize the domains. Aside from the obvious route of creating a phishing functionality, it’s also possible to execute a man-in-the-middle attack, the researcher explained.

“I am making the SSL handshake with the user,” he said. “The original Google application is served, it functions an expected, but I am exposed to the user’s traffic with the domain. Therefore, I can change the body of Google’s response.”

This man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack technique can be used in a few different ways, he said. For instance, with a little effort, it’s possible to extract login credentials or tokens.

“Google uses the domain accounts.google.com for authentication,” Lumelsky explained. “I can, for example, override all the <a> tags in the HTML. Instead of pointing them to a subdomain in google.com (e.g accounts.google.com) we can point them to a custom phishing login page, within ɢoogletranslate.com domain. We can steal the user’s login credentials to Google by overriding the links within the page, and pointing them to [the maliciously registered domain] accounts.ɢoogletranslate.com (The sign-in button’s HTML tag’s href attribute).”

Further, an attacker could inject a malicious <script> tag into the hijacked HTTP body and execute code on a client browser connecting to the fake website.

“A majority of the user agents that visited the links were old browsers that haven’t been updated for a long time,” the researcher concluded. “Many of the Chrome, Firefox and Safari user agents from my access logs are devices which are vulnerable to one-day attacks (including sandbox escape).”

To protect oneself, site surfers should always be suspicious of off letters inside domains in links; and admins should implement rules within their security protocols that flag homographic hosts.

Lumelsky also filed a bug report with Google, identifying all of the places in the kill chain where this attack method could be thwarted. This includes not allowing “ɢoogle” top-level domains to be sold; or, if they are, to at least not allow them to be auto-suggested as they were by the Google Domains registrar. Another weak point the fact that Google’s JavaScript did not check that “(window.location” was a legitimate Google domain before allowing the script to be loaded.

The discussions are ongoing, but Google’s response, the researcher said, was: “Thank you for the considerable material, the thought behind it, as well as the actual money used to secure those domain names in creating this report. Homographic attacks are always interesting in their social-engineering application, but more challenging is deploying an attack that will trick not only the user, but also the infrastructure.”

Threatpost reached out to Google for further comment.

The attack method isn’t limited to Google, of course, and there are other weaknesses that it exploits. For instance, Lumelsky pointed out that people should not be able to request an SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt for homographic domains.

“Until there is a solution out there, every big company or service will have to secure their domains and assets, by spending lots of money on similar domain names,” he said. “The steps to reproduce this kind of attack are pretty simple for anyone with basic Linux and networking knowledge."
Spear phishing,"Phishing Attack Skirts Detection With YouTube

Attackers are using YouTube redirect links, whitelisted by various security defense mechanisms, to evade detection.

Researchers are warning of an increase in phishing emails that use YouTube redirect links, which help attackers skirt traditional defense measures.

If certain malicious URLs are blocked by web browser phishing filters, attackers commonly use a redirector URL to bypass these filters and redirect the victim to their phishing landing page. URL redirects have been used in previous campaigns, including malicious redirect code affecting Joomla and WordPress websites and HTML redirectors being used by Evil Corp. Now, a new campaign is using legitimate YouTube redirect links.

“Most organizations allow the use of platforms such as YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook and whitelist the domains, allowing for potentially malicious redirects to open without any fuss,” said researchers with Cofense, in a Wednesday post.”



Researchers said that the emails using this method originated from a fraud domain, sharepointonline-po.com, which was recently registered, on Feb. 19. The attackers purported to be with SharePoint, a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. The email indicated that a new file has been uploaded to the target company’s SharePoint site, and included an option to “View File.”

When a user hovers their mouse over the “View File” URL, they see a seemingly-legitimate embedded YouTube link (hXXps://www[.]youtube[.]com/redirect?v=6l7J1i1OkKs&q=http%3A%2F%2FCompanyname[.]sharepointonline-ert[.]pw).

YouTube phishing redirect 

 

“Although the email may appear illegitimate to a trained ey””A curious or unsuspecting end user may click the button expecting to see a legitimate file,” said researchers.

When they click on the URL, victims are redirected to YouTube, and then immediately redirected to another link (companyname[.]sharepointonline-ert[.]pw), which is the final phishing landing page.

“So far, all phishing links from this campaign utilize some variation on sharepointonline-ert[.]pw, specifically sharepointonline-xxx followed by a variation of three letters, with the top-level domain always being .pw,” said researchers. “Each of these fraud domains are quickly registered with Namecheap and used for this campaign, which suggests the possibility of bot automation.”phishing The phishing landing page itself is hosted on a legitimate Google page (googleapis.com), which means its certificate is verified (presumably by Google) –  helping the page appear more legitimate: “Use of this legitimate website allows the threat actor to sneak by any Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) or other security controls,” researchers stressed.

This page purports to be a typical Microsoft branded login page. The recipient email address is appended within the URL, which automatically populates the login box with the account name. While the login page is attacker-controlled, and passwords that are entered are sent to the threat actor, nothing appears amiss with the page – in fact, it is almost a perfect replica, researchers said.

“The main differences are: The box surrounding the login is black instead of white; the small detail of the banner at the bottom has different information than Microsoft’s actual login; and the copyright year is showing as 2019,” they said.

Attackers continue to raise the bar when it comes to phishing attacks. More recently they have been spotted tapping into the panic around the coronavirus with spear-phishing emails; and, attackers are also using anything from taxes to real estate decoys – and even HIV test results – to convince victims to hand over their credentials."
Email Phishing,"Spear-Phishing Attack Lures Victims With ‘HIV Results’

Attackers are purporting to send victims HIV test results – but in reality are convincing them to download the Koadic RAT.

Recently discovered spear-phishing emails are using a unique “scare-factor” lure to convince victims to open attached malicious Microsoft Excel documents: Their HIV test results.

Researchers are warning of a recent campaign involving emails claiming to come from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a legitimate medical complex in Nashville, Tenn. The emails were sent to a slew of unnamed companies in various industries, including global insurance, healthcare, and pharmaceutical firms. If victims clicked on the embedded attachment in the emails, they were infected with the Koadic RAT, which allows attackers to run programs and access victims’ data, including sensitive personal and financial information.

“Healthcare concerns drive us to do a lot of things like change our diet, work out more, and take medication,” said researchers with Proofpoint on Tuesday. “But they should never lead us to fall victim to phishing campaign. Threat actors regularly use purported health information in their phishing lures because it evokes an emotional response that is particularly effective in tricking potential victims to open malicious attachments or click malicious links.”



Victims received an email purporting to come from “Vanderbit [SIC] Medical,” with the subject line “Test result of medical analysis.” The body of the email encourages victims to open a malicious Microsoft Excel attachment titled “TestResults.xlsb,” claiming that the recipient’s HIV results are contained within it.

phishing attackOnce the victim opens the attachment, the Excel document opens and prompts the user to enable macros – and once they do that, the document then downloads the Koadic RAT.

Koadic is an open source, post-exploitation remote access trojan that uses the Windows Script Host. Originally, Koadic was intended as a tool for network defenders and allows the actor to take complete control over a user’s system.

However, researchers said in recent years it has been used by a variety of nation state actors, including both Chinese and Russian state-sponsored groups, as well as attackers associated with Iran. In 2017, researchers said that the China-linked Stone Panda APT was using Koadic in its “Chessmaster” campaign against Japan. And in 2018, the Fancy Bear APT was seen leveraging Koadic with its custom Zebrocy malware.

Sherrod DeGrippo with Proofpoint told Threatpost that the emails don’t appear to have been targeted in terms of individual recipients. However, they do appear to have been very focused in terms of their targeting of industries, she said.

“While we do not have insight into the medical history of targeted individuals, we have no reason to believe that the attackers had specific awareness of the recipient’s HIV status or whether they were patients of Vanderbilt (which was misspelled as “Vanderbit” within the campaign),” she told Threatpost. “We do regularly observe threat actors taking advantage of medical scenarios that can create a sense of urgency. This campaign is social engineering based on fear. They know that the individuals targeted will be more likely to click on a potentially malicious message or download an attachment due to either concern for their own safety if they have recently been tested or out of curiosity if they haven’t been tested.”

This most recent spear-phishing attack is a reflection of attackers continuing to use innovative lures to convince victims to click on malicious links or attachments. More recently they have been spotted tapping into the panic around the Coronavirus with spear-phishing emails that mention the virus. Beyond that, attackers are also using anything from taxes to real estate decoys.

phishing attack HIVResearchers said that sensitive health-related information is typically safely transmitted using secured messaging portals, over the phone, or in-person. If potential victims receive emails claiming to have sensitive health-related information, researchers said they should their medical provider’s patient portal directly or call their doctor rather than open the email.

“This latest campaign serves as a reminder that health-related lures didn’t start and won’t stop with the recent Coronavirus-themed lures we observed,” researchers said. “They are a constant tactic as attackers recognize the utility of the health-related ‘scare factor.'” We encourage users to treat health-related emails with caution, especially those that claim to have sensitive health-related information.”"

Microsoft OneNote
Share this article:

A recent phishing campaign used OneNote to distribute the Agent Tesla keylogger.

A phishing campaign was recently discovered leveraging OneNote, Microsoft’s digital notebook that automatically saves and syncs notes, to bypass detection tools and download malware onto victims’ systems.

The attacker was utilizing OneNote as a way to easily experiment with various lures that either delivered the credential-stealing Agent Tesla keylogger or linked to a phishing page – or both. The attack first started with an email to victims that contained a link to the OneNote document.

“Thanks to the ease of use and accessibility of OneNote, the threat actor was able to update a ‘phishing notebook’ multiple times a day, experiment with various intrusion methods, and improve the odds to successfully evade email security controls,” said researchers with Cofense in a Tuesday analysis. “Numerous Agent Tesla Keylogger payloads as well as links to different credential phishing websites were included in the campaign.”



The threat actor first sent an email to companies purporting to be a marketing manager sending an order invoice (Cofense did not list the scope of targets or how effective the campaign has been thus far). The link to the order request invoice was actually a tiny[.]cc link, which eventually brought victims to a OneNote document. Over the span of two weeks, researchers said that threat actors swapped out the layout of this OneNote page, cycling between four different templates to deliver a credential phishing portal and unique malware samples.

For instance, in one of the earlier template versions the page sends two URLs – one with an Office 365 credential phishing page and the other that downloads malware. Other later template versions were tweaked so that they linked to malware downloads rather than also linking to credential phishing sites.

The various OneNote versions had different lures as well. One told victims that a transfer had been successfully received from their bank invoice and told them to click on a link to view the details of the transfer (which actually downloaded malware), while another told them that their OneDrive isn’t synced with their organization’s backup, and asked them to “auto verify” in order to fix the issue — which brought them to a phishing page.  Microsoft OneNote phishing

In all cases where malware was delivered, the malware was a first-stage downloader, which attempted to download an encrypted binary. This binary, the Agent Tesla keylogger, was then decrypted and run in memory. Agent Tesla, used in various campaigns over the years, collects and exfiltrates stored logins and keystrokes on victims’ systems. Interestingly, the malware tied to this specific campaign failed due to improper customization, indicating that the threat actor may be inexperienced, researchers said.

“Initially, the two first-stage malware downloaders had their encrypted payloads stored on Google Drive,” said researchers. “Newer loaders attempted to fetch payloads from a compromised host, the same host that provided the malware downloaders. The newer loaders did, however, fail to accomplish their tasks due to improper customization by the threat actor. Such error is indicative of a less-capable operator who leverages pre-made kits but falls short on modifying them.”

Microsoft OneNote
The use of OneNote in this campaign gives attackers several advantages, said researchers. For one, it allowed the threat actor to easily swap between various templates and adapt to different lures for different victims. The use of OneNote also allowed threat actors to slip their phishing attack against traditional defenses set up in environments protected by Microsoft Exchange Online Protection and FireEye enterprise gateways.

Microsoft OneNote phishing

“Based on the inherent risk posed by trusted sources, traditional protections trained against OneNote and similar services may prove ineffective,” said researchers. “If not properly addressed, this could pave the way to a prolific infection vector for malware.”

Beyond OneNote being hosted on OneDrive, cybercriminals can – and have been found to – leverage a wide array of trusted cloud hosting sources for credential phishing, including documents hosted on Microsoft Sway, Microsoft SharePoint, Google Docs or even Zoho Docs (offered up by CRM software and free mail provider Zoho).

“Having a readily accessible service that requires no maintenance and effectively acts as a free database significantly lowers the upkeep needed for the credential phish,” said researchers. “A downside is that these services have evolved to look for nefarious activity, and Google displays a warning at the bottom of the form that warns the user to ‘never submit passwords through Google Forms.’ Other services such as Microsoft Forms and survey sites can also enable this type of attack.”"

Customers of RBC, HSBC, TD, Meridian, BNC and Chase are targeted in latest attack.

A mobile phishing campaign that targeted customers of more than a dozen North American banks, including Chase, Royal Bank of Canada and TD Bank, managed to hook nearly 4,000 victims. The attacks used an automated SMS tool to blast bogus security text messages to mobile phone users between June and last month.

Mobile security firm Lookout identified the “mobile-first” phishing campaign and said that victims were sent text messages claiming that their bank detected suspicious activity tied to their account. The SMS-based messages each included a link to one of over 200 phishing pages.

“The [phishing pages] are built to look legitimate on mobile, with login pages mirroring mobile banking application layouts and sizing, as well as including links like, ‘Mobile Banking Security and Privacy’ or ‘Activate Mobile Banking,'” wrote Lookout researchers Apurva Kumar, staff security intelligence engineer and Kristin Del Rosso, senior security intelligence engineer, in a report published Friday.


In their report, researchers pointed out that mobile-based phishing campaigns have advantages over their desktop equivalents. For one, mobile phishing messages and spoofed sites are less likely to be scrutinized, they said.

“Since mobile users are typically on the move and less likely to scrutinize the authenticity of an SMS message, text messages have become an attractive new attack vector,” researchers wrote.

Also, often a condensed mobile site will not display an entire URL, making it harder for a user to determine a site’s legitimacy.

Some of the banks impacted by the scam included; Scotiabank, CIBC, , Royal Bank of Canada, UNI, HSBC, Tangerine, TD Bank, Meridian, Laurentian, Manulife, BNC and Chase.

If hooked, victims were prompted to divulge answers to security questions such as their date of birth, credit-card expiration date, account number, username and password. Over the course of the seven-month campaign, researchers said, over 3,900 unique IP addresses (phones users) logged into one of the adversaries’ servers.

“With the increase in multi-factor authentication for many apps, including those used for mobile banking, consumers are increasingly accustomed to banks communicating using SMS messages,” researchers wrote.

A traffic analysis of just one bogus mobile banking page revealed more than 800 unique clicks on the provided link sent via SMS. Lookout said that based on its research, it determined many victims followed the link, only answering a limited number of questions before abandoning the phishing attempt.

“A screenshot (see right image) from one phishing page highlights the IP addresses of the devices who clicked on the link, as well as how far into the phishing campaign they went (e.g., providing no information, making it to the ‘date of birth’ page, or fully completing the phish),” according to the report."

A recent phishing scam targeted Puerto Rico’s Industrial Development Company.

A phishing scam has swindled a Puerto Rico government agency out of more than $2.6 million, according to reports.

According to reports, the email-based phishing scam hit Puerto Rico’s Industrial Development Company, which is a government-owned corporation aimed at driving economic development to the island along with local and foreign investors.

The agency reportedly received an email alleging a change to a banking account tied to remittance payments, which is a transfer of money (often by a foreign worker) to an individual in their home country. The agency sent this payment to a fraudulent account, Jan. 17.



“This is a very serious situation, extremely serious,” Manuel Laboy, executive director of the agency, told the Associated Press. “We want it to be investigated until the last consequences.”

The agency filed a police complaint on Wednesday regarding the scam, but further questions regarding how the scam was discovered, whether the agency’s operations have been impacted, and more still remain. Threatpost has reached out to the Industrial Development Company for further information.

Phishing scams continue to hit companies hard in terms of losses. Just this week, the FBI in its IC3 annual cybercrime report said that phishing and similar ploys was a top crime complaint reported to the FBI in 2019. Another form of email-based scam, business email compromise (BEC) – which the FBI said cost victims $1.7 billion in 2019 – has also continued to target large corporations and governments for profit.

In 2019, these types of attacks scammed media conglomerate Nikkei ($29 million), a Texas school district ($2.3 million) and even a community housing nonprofit ($1.2 million). Other victims of scams include the City of Ocala in Florida, which was swindled out of $742,000, and a church in Brunswick, Ohio that was scammed out of $1.75 million in August.

Authorities say that keeping an eye out for fraud and verifying any financial requests in person is the best way to avoid phishing and BEC scams.

“In the same way your bank and online accounts have started to require two-factor authentication—apply that to your life,” Donna Gregory, the chief of IC3 said this week. “Verify requests in person or by phone, double check web and email addresses, and don’t follow the links provided in any messages.”"
Mobile phishing,"Active PayPal Phishing Scam Targets SSNs, Passport Photos

Phishing emails have been uncovered that request a full rundown of personal data – even asking for photos of passports.

A recently uncovered phishing campaign, targeting PayPal users, pulls out all the stops and asks victims for the complete spectrum of personal data – even going so far as to ask for social security numbers and uploaded photos of their passports.

The campaign starts with a fairly run-of-the-mill phishing email, purporting to be from the online payment company’s notifications center, which warns victims that their account has been limited because it was logged into from a new browser or device. The email recipient must verify his or her identity by clicking on a button, which is a bit.ly address that then redirects the browser to an attacker-owned landing page, which asks for a complete rundown of personal data.

The ongoing campaign showcases “the current ‘let’s take all that we can get’ mentality of the attackers quite well,” Jan Kopriva, with the Computer Security Incident Response team at information tech company ALEF NULA, said in a Monday SANS ISC InfoSec Forum post. “Over the years, phishing authors seem to have learned that once they hook a phish, they should try to get all the information they can from them. This is the reason why many current campaigns don’t stop after getting the usual credit card information, but go further.”



Like other phishing campaigns, this particular scam comes with some major red flags. While the initial email sender shows up under the name “Support,” a closer look at the email address shows it is from [service53659(at)ovh.com], rather than a legitimate PayPal email address. Some parts of the phishing email make strange use of exclamation points – For instance, the top of the email says “PayPal Notifications Center !” and the phishing link button reads, “Secure and update my account now !”

PayPal phishing Also, while the landing page pretends to be a legitimate PayPal login screen with the PayPal brand at the top, the phishing page (https://www[.]leemou[.]com/files/selector/) is clearly not a PayPal domain.

However, if victims are gullible enough to enter their credentials, a general information gathering form is then displayed.  The landing page at first asks for the victims’ billing information and credit card details, but later takes the campaign a step further and asks victims to fill in a social security number and card PIN number.

If they manage to collect that information, attackers take the scam to the next level, on the last page asking victims to upload photos of their valid government issued photo ID, passport, driving license or credit card.

“What might be a bit unfortunate from the standpoint of a potential victim is that after the user uploads a file, the page is refreshed but no confirmation is displayed,” said Kopriva. “This means that a less vigilant user might upload multiple photos of documents while thinking that their previous attempts were invalid for some reason.”

PayPal phishing

It’s far from the first scam to involve PayPal. In November, a Utah eye clinic informed 20,000 patients that they were the victims of a data breach that happened a year and a half ago and linked patients to a scam involving PayPal. Recently, the prolific phishing gang known as 16Shop has also added PayPal customers to its target set. Kopriva said he has reported the phishing scam to PayPal. PayPal has said that legitimate emails will always come from a PayPal.com address and will also address customers by their first and last names. Emails will also never ask users for sensitive information like their bank account or password, or contain any attachments, PayPal said in a post about scams on its website.

“Though verifying a correct sender address is important, it’s not enough. It’s important to look at the entire email,” according to PayPal. “When you check your account, always enter “www.PayPal.com” into your browser instead of clicking a link in an email.”

Phishing campaigns continue to hit businesses and personal consumers, usually using updated, tricky tactics to avoid detection or luring victims with trending themes like coronavirus, sporting events like the World Cup and more."
Spear phishing,"Phishing Campaign Targets 250 Android Apps with Anubis Malware

New attacks discovered by Cofense can perform keylogging, steal data and completely hijack a mobile device.

A new phishing campaign is attempting to deliver sophisticated malware that can completely hijack an Android mobile device to steal user credentials, install a keylogger and even hold a device’s data for ransom.

The attacks are designed for mobile inboxes and leverage the Anubis malware, a sophisticated trojan used originally for cyber espionage and later repurposed as a banking trojan. Researchers at Cofense, who discovered the campaign, said the malware targets more than 250 Android apps with tailored login overlay screens used to capture credentials inputted into the apps.

Messages contain links to an Android Package Kit (APK) file that if downloaded and executed will launch a fake version of “Google Play Protect”. Next, the installation process attempts to trick the user into agreeing to run an unsigned Android app on the targeted device that would give adversaries complete control of the targeted handset.



The attack first involves a typical phishing email that asks users to download an invoice from an email that appears to come from a trusted contact, according to a blog published Thursday by Cofense researcher Marcel Feller.

“When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded,” Feller wrote. “Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable ‘Google Play Protect’… However, this is not a genuine ‘Google Play Protect’ screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect.”

The malware name, Anubis, is a reference to the ancient Egyptian god of embalming and the dead, often depicted as half human and jackal.

The campaign mainly scans phones for banking and financial apps, but also checks for popular marketplace apps such as eBay or Amazon so it can steal relevant user financial data.

“Once an application has been identified, Anubis overlays the original application with a fake login page to capture the user’s credentials,” he wrote.

If installed, the malware’s capabilities include capturing screenshots, enabling or changing administration settings, opening and visiting any URL, recording audio and initiating phone calls.

“Anubis can completely hijack an Android mobile device, steal data, record phone calls, and even hold the device to ransom by encrypting the victim’s personal files,” Feller wrote.

Anubis samples have been identified in the wild being used as part of other campaigns after its actor allegedly was arrested and the source code to the malware leaked last year. In November, for instance, code from Anubis turned up in a new custom mobile banking malware for Android, dubbed Gnip.

The new campaign—which affects several iterations of the Android operating system, dating back to version 4.0.3—combines various nefarious functions in one package, including keylogging, credential-stealing and even a ransomware module that searches a device’s internal and external storage and encrypts them using RC4, Feller noted. Cofense does not indicate the complete range of Android operating system versions potentially impacted.

While the campaign primarily puts consumer mobile users in danger, it also threatens the enterprise and corporate environments due to the increasing use of BYOD policies, the researcher said. Those most at risk for the latest campaign are users who have configured their Android mobile device to receive work-related emails and allow installation of unsigned applications.

The campaign also includes a keylogger, which works in every app installed on the targeted device. However, the keylogger is a post-infection feature and is enabled remotely via the attacker’s command-and-control server, Feller wrote.

To avoid being a victim of this latest phishing attack, Cofense recommends that users limit their installation of apps on corporate devices, using only apps created by trusted developers that they download from official marketplaces, he added."

16Shop – One-Stop Phishing
Share this article:


A sophisticated malware-as-a-service phishing kit includes full customer service and anti-detection technologies.

A prolific phishing gang known as 16Shop has added PayPal customers to its target set.

According to researchers at the ZeroFOX Alpha Team, the latest version of the group’s phishing kit is designed with a number of features that are aimed to steal as much personally identifiable information (PII) as possible from users of the popular money-transfer service, including login credentials, geolocation, email address, credit-card information, phone number and more.

In investigating the kit’s infrastructure, researchers uncovered that to establish contact, the kit sends a POST request to a command-and-control (C2) server, with a password, domain and path as a form of operational security. Stolen information is subsequently exfiltrated via SMTP to an attacker-controlled email inbox. It can be used to create phishing pages in English, Japanese, Spanish, German and Thai.

The researchers were able to intercept traffic between the kit and the C2 server, and gain access to the server panel that 16Shop rents to users. They found that it’s so user-friendly that users could use it to deploy phishing pages without needing to understand any of the underlying protocols or technology.

“Much like a SaaS [software-as-a-service] product, user experience and dashboard analytics are keys to success,” ZeroFOX said in a posting on the new kit, on Tuesday. “The 16Shop kit panel is professionally done, with reactive elements and data updating in real time. Whether its login credentials collected, emails collected, credit cards, bots or clicks, kit operators are able to see the success of their operation in a quick and efficient manner.”

The analysis also showed that 16Shop is using three different anti-bot and anti-indexing features. The idea is to block automated crawlers used by security vendors, as well as web indexers, to limit exposure of the kit.

“The first [detection-evasion feature is] a simple blacklist file under security, with a file named blacklist.dat,” explained the researchers. “Secondly, they use an open-source anti-crawling library called CrawlerDetect. The latest versions also employ an integration with antibot.pw.”

Antibot has an API endpoint where 16Shop operators can load an API key into the kit, and the kit will send the visitor’s User-Agent out to antibot to see if a visitor is a “bot or not.” Antibot also offers services for link shortening, link clickthrough and tracking, as well as Bank Identification Number (BIN) checking.

“The authors also make an honest attempt to block as much security scanning and indexing engines as possible, as the quicker these automated tools uncover phishing websites, the faster they get taken down,” ZeroFOX noted.

16Shop – One-Stop Phishing
As noted, 16Shop is distributed in a malware-as-a-service model, with operators likely located in Southeast Asia.

“16Shop has been publicly attributed to a group called Indonesian Cyber Army, and specifically, one of the authors, DevilScreaM, has his moniker plastered over the kit code and distribution network,” said the researchers.

ZeroFOX said that a rental comes with detailed installation and tear down instructions, and some of the versions have customer service options, including live support channels, social media pages and email addresses. Free updates and access to upsell portals round out the package.

“For example, a kit author could purchase only an Amazon kit, and then see a new PayPal kit [in the portal] with great antibot features, so it incurs a ‘fear of missing out’ and causes the operator to purchase the new package,” the researchers said. They added, “16Shop employs digital rights management (DRM), limiting the number of deploys per kit unless you buy more.”

The kit initially targeted Apple users, but then moved on to Amazon last year, according to the writeup. ZeroFOX also saw evidence that 16Shop is working on adding American Express to its kit as well.

“These kit authors use product features and marketing tactics from SaaS products to advertise, sell, deploy, maintain and update their products,” concluded ZeroFOX."

This new skimming/phishing hybrid threat tactic means that even stores that send customers to external payment processors are vulnerable.

A fresh splinter group under the Magecart umbrella has been discovered ramping up activity starting in August-September of 2019. It’s using a unique codebase and different tactics to carry out its attacks, according to researchers.

Magecart is an umbrella term encompassing several different threat groups who all use the same modus operandi: They compromise websites (mainly built on the Magento e-commerce platform) in order to inject card-skimming scripts on checkout pages, stealing unsuspecting customers’ payment card details and other information entered into the fields on the page.

According to an analysis from RiskIQ, the new group, dubbed Full(z) House by researchers, has innovated when it comes to the Magecart blueprint. It gets its name from using two different attack approaches: Phishing and web skimming. For the former, it’s using generic phishing to gather and sell “fullz,” an underground slang term meaning a full set of an individual’s personally identifying information plus financial data. They have a dedicated store for this purpose, researchers found, called “BlueMagicStore.” In web-skimming arena, the group is harvesting during e-commerce checkouts, and selling credit-card information on its carding store, which is named “CardHouse.”



“At times, we find criminal groups operating for a long time in one particular ecosystem dip their toe in another and experiment with new methods of monetizing,” said RiskIQ researchers, writing in a post on Tuesday. “For example, last year, Magecart Group 4, which seemed to operate in a banking malware ecosystem, began performing card-skimming attacks.”

In their analysis, RiskIQ researchers saw some overlap in the attack infrastructure used to carry out both types of attacks. And, the Dark Web stores also have infrastructure overlap with this operational apparatus.

BlueMagicStore’s inventory comes from active phishing campaigns targeting customers of various financial institutions, the researchers found.

“The [phishing] pages are part of a framework,” they wrote. “They have different templates mimicking every payment provider they implement, but the backend dealing with the information is one and the same for all. While the group uses many different domains, their favorite phishing target remains PayPal.”

On the card-skimming front, the group wrote its own skimmer, according to RiskIQ – which is an unusual move.

“The majority of criminals rely on skimming kits, buying pre-made skimmers from others—there are only a handful of operators now that maintain their own code,” they said.

The skimmer masquerades as a Google Analytics script. It hooks into every input field, and waits for an input change to check if there’s data to steal.

“This implementation is primitive and works more like a keylogger with data validation than a skimmer,” said the researchers. “These criminals are new at skimming and figuring it out as they go….[however, they did] introduce a clever technique that performs a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack on e-commerce transactions.”

To carry the MiTM attacks out, the group sets up a page with a template mimicking a known payment processor. When a user attempts to buy something on a compromised store, the store redirects the visitor to a fake payment page where the shopper enters their financial information. That’s then collected by the attackers.

“We have been chronicling Magecart and other web-skimming groups and chronicling changes in tools and tactics,” according to the researchers. “The Fullz group crossed over from the phishing ecosystem to bring an entirely new skill set to the online skimming game. Creating fake external payment pages masquerading as legitimate financial institutions and then redirecting victims to these phishing pages to fill out their payment data adds a new element to the web-skimming landscape. This new skimming/phishing hybrid threat tactic means that even stores that send customers to external payment processors are vulnerable.”"

Using a real Office 365 account at a legitimate company to send out lures helps phishers evade email defenses.

A phishing campaign that uses legitimate organizations’ Office 365 infrastructure to send emails has emerged onto the cyberscam scene.

According to Michael Tyler at PhishLabs, cybercriminals are looking to compromise Microsoft Office 365 administrator accounts to send out phishing lures – thus ensuring the emails come from legitimate, validated domains.

“This is beneficial for attackers because many email filtering solutions leverage the reputation of a sender domain as a major component of determining whether to block an email,” he explained, in a recent posting on the campaign. “Well-established domains with a track record of sending benign messages are less likely to be quickly blocked by these systems. This increases the deliverability and efficiency of phishing lures.”



The adversaries are gaining access to legitimate Office 365 installations with administrative privileges (via phished, brute-forced or stolen credentials). Office 365 admins have administrative control over all email accounts on a domain, so the cyberattackers are using those privileges to set up a new account in the system. Then, the lures are sent out from that freshly created account.

“By using a created account, the attacker does not need to worry about a legitimate user stumbling upon the malicious activity taking place, either by observing outgoing mail or receiving automated responses from failed delivery attempts,” Taylor explained.

phishing office 365For now, the crooks are going after other Office 365 credentials. In the scam emails (which use either an “Action required!” or “We placed a hold on your account” subject lines), targets are presented with a link that leads to a spoofed login page for Office 365. However, the attackers could use their access for other malicious activities, Taylor pointed out.

“Depending on the current configuration of the Office 365 instance, a compromised admin account may enable retrieval of user emails, or complete takeover of other email accounts on the domain,” he said. “In addition, Office 365 admins often have elevated privileges on other systems within an organization, potentially allowing further compromises to take place via password reset attempts or abusing single-sign-on systems.”

This technique of leveraging the reputation of a compromised domain to distribute phishing emails is being seen in a “spray-and-pray,” non-targeted campaign that has hit a wide variety of enterprises and industries, according to PhishLabs analysis. The firm said that multiple validated domains have been compromised in order to send out phishing lures.

Trends in Phishing Tactics
According to Vade Secure’s “Phishers’ Favorites” report for Q3 2019, unique Microsoft phishing URLs detected in Q3 2019 were down by 31.5 percent compared to the second quarter. However, Office 365 phishing attacks are still very common, with more than 150 unique URLs appearing per day, the Vade data shows.

Office 365 phishing techniques have also gotten savvier as defenses and user awareness have gotten better, according to the report.

“Cybercriminals are always evolving their phishing tactics, and each quarter we see them becoming smarter and more innovative in order to keep up with the defenses being deployed by email users and businesses,” said Adrien Gendre, chief solution architect at Vade. “Despite the drop in related Microsoft phishing URLs, it’s important for organizations to remain on high alert as our researchers have uncovered a number of new and sophisticated methods of attacking Office 365 users.”

phishing scam For instance, some phishers have shifted towards email randomization, such as using a modified brand logo (e.g. Microsoft logo on a blue background) in order to bypass template-matching and feature-matching algorithms. , according to the report.  that can only identify exact matches of the image.

“Moreover, cybercriminals have begun to shift their focus to the construction of the email, leveraging various randomization techniques to break through traditional defense layers,” according to the Vade report. “This minimizes the need for unique URLs for each message because the phisher is able to reuse the same webpage across a large number of emails.”

Interestingly, in Q3, PayPal overtook Microsoft to claim the top spot for the number of unique phishing links related to it. Netflix meanwhile moved up to the third spot with a 14.1 percent increase quarter-over-quarter and a 73.7 percent year-over-year growth in unique phishing URLs."
Email Phishing,"Google Analytics Emerges as a Phishing Tool

Web analytics help phishers hone their attacks — but website defenders can also use these tactics to better detect the scope of attacks and mitigate their effects.

Cybercriminals are leveraging key technical markers used in web analytics—particularly Google Analytics—to create more sophisticated and targeted phishing attacks, new research has found.

However, this also makes them more susceptible to detection by organizations defending their sites against attacks, researchers said.

With 56.1 percent of websites now using analytics to generate reports on user behavior and page views, and to track user activity throughout sites, cybercriminals have caught on and are leveraging these and other uses of analytics for their own dirty work, the report found. After all, criminals who launch phishing attacks have the same interest as typical website designers in driving traffic to their phishing sites and luring users to click on links in emails, according to a new report by network security provider Akamai Technologies.



“As phishing has evolved over the years, criminals have learned that technical markers, like browser identification, geo-location and operating system [identification], can help adjust the phishing website’s visibility, and enable more granular targeting,” according to the research from Tomer Shiomo, senior security research team lead at Akamai Labs, released on Wednesday  “In order to evaluate these metrics, kit developers use third-party analytic products, such as those developed by Google, Bing or Yandex, to gather the necessary details.”

But even while attackers are using website tools to create malicious campaigns, Akamai showed in its research how those defending their sites against phishing can turn the tables and detect phishers using the same technology.

Analytics uses something called a unique identifier (UID) to identify each customer. This UID is comprised of two parts–the unique analytics network account ID (XXXXX), and the view, or property, number, Shiomo explained.

For its research, Akamai scanned 62,627 active phishing URLs, 54,261 of which are non-blank pages that belong to 28,906 unique domains. Researchers discovered 874 domains with UIDs; 396 of those were unique Google Analytic accounts. Akamai also discovered that 75 of the UIDs were used for more than one website.

By analyzing the source code of these websites, researchers observed phishing tactics making use of these analytic UIDs, Shiomo said, identifying several reasons related to malicious behavior that could explain the presence of the analytic identifiers, he said.

One reason could be that a bad actor was reusing a UID for phishing purposes, he said. “While attempting to duplicate the original website, the developers used copying tools such as HTTrack or wget to download the source code, reusing the analytic ID shipped with the original code,” Shiomo wrote.

The use of UIDs also could be evidence of analytic IDs set by the framework developer to monitor the victim’s movement through the phishing website, he said.

Additionally, the UIDs observed by Akamai researchers could be the mark of “phishing websites that were sinkholed by the targeted company,” showing a site that was previously redirected by a phishing campaign, now re-routed back to the original website, Shiomo said.

This last example shows how those defending sites against phishing can beat cybercriminals at their own game, taking the technology being used against them to glean more not only about user behavior on a site, but also cybercriminal behavior, he said.

“Using analytics can help you understand the full scale of a phishing campaign, and defenders can use this data to compare with internal signatures, for a more rounded detection and remediation process,” Shiomo wrote."

A targeted campaign is delivering an information-stealing malware called Predator the Thief.

A phishing campaign claiming to deliver emailed subpoenas is targeting insurance and retail companies.

According to researchers, the phishing emails are spoofing the UK Ministry of Justice, aiming to capitalize on scare tactics to convince targets to click on an embedded link to “learn more about the case” by saying that the recipient has 14 days to comply with the subpoena notice. If the target clicks on the link, he or she will find themselves infected with Predator the Thief, a publicly available information-stealing malware that’s not often seen in phishing campaigns.

“The emails can appear quite convincing upon initial inspection, but a closer look reveals obvious irregularities,” Mollie MacDougall, researcher with the Cofense Intelligence, told Threatpost. “Masquerading as UK Ministry of Justice correspondence produces an increased potential for users to fall for the phish, even though some portions of the email contain misnomers such as ‘Department of Justice’ rather than Ministry of Justice. Recipients that are not educated about the UK judicial system are likely to fear a potential consequence from this daunting email, thus falling victim for the threat actor’s trap.”

As for the reach of this campaign, all identified targets (there are 10 so far in Cofense’s telemetry) are in the EMEA region, she added. And, the threat actor is likely not that sophisticated.

“Threat actors are capitalizing on publicly available tools, as is most common throughout the phishing threat landscape,” MacDougall told Threatpost. “We are not certain about the person or group behind this campaign, but it is plausible to assess that the actor is not overly familiar with the UK judicial system and lacks some attention to detail, thus likely not being of an advanced or nation-state level origin.”

To lend an air of legitimacy, the enclosed link uses Google Docs and Microsoft OneDrive for the infection chain; thus, the link within the email is actually benign and leads to a Google Docs page, themed to fool a user into thinking the service is conducting security checks. In turn, the Google Docs page has a redirection link pointing to a direct Microsoft OneDrive download. A macro-laden document is retrieved and used as a first stage downloader to execute a sample of Predator the Thief.

phishing subpoena 

“The initial Google Docs link contains a redirect chain that eventually leads to a malicious macro-laden Microsoft Word file,” explained Aaron Riley, security researcher at Cofense, in a blog post on Wednesday. “The macro, upon execution, downloads the malware via PowerShell, which is a sample of the Predator the Thief information-stealer.”

According to Cofense, Predator the Thief then infects the endpoint and attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data; it targets cryptocurrency wallets, network configurations, browser information, VPN and FTP credentials, email data and even gaming logins. It can also take screenshots of an infected machine. The information is gathered and stored in a file named “information.log” before being shipped off to the command-and-control (C2) server via an HTTP POST to a network endpoint “gate.get” by default – once the data is successfully exfiltrated to the C2, the binary then cleans up parts of the infection and self-terminates.

“This infection clean-up process makes it much harder for endpoint forensic investigations that do not leverage verbose event logs and an endpoint detection system,” Riley wrote.

According to MacDougall, the exfiltrated information, however, can be used for a number of purposes, with gaining profit through stolen credentials being the most likely.”

The use of benign-seeming links to get past email defenses is a technique that’s cropping up of late in the phishing world; in this case, since the Google Docs URL is legitimate, the email may pass inspection by secure email gateways. Disabling Microsoft macros by default and monitoring PowerShell execution alongside educating users on the dangers of enabling macros is a safeguard against this threat.

“Information would only be stolen should the infection chain be successful, which would require the targets to click on the link and then download from OneDrive the document laden with malicious macros,” MacDougall told Threatpost. “If those macros are enabled, the macro would download the Predator the Thief malware.”"

Back-To-School Attacks
New Tricks
Share this article:

Silent Librarian cyberattackers are switching up tactics in a phishing scheme bent on stealing student credentials.

Silent Librarian is targeting university students in full force with a revamped phishing campaign. The threat group, aiming to steal student login credentials, is using new tricks that bring more credibility to its phishing emails and helping it avoid detection.

The threat group (also known as TA407 and Cobalt Dickens), which operates out of Iran, has been on the prowl for credentials since the start of the 2019 school year in September, launching low-volume, highly-targeted, socially engineered emails that eventually trick students into handing over their login credentials.

But more recent campaigns show the cyberattackers using shortened URL links in their phishing emails, which make it more difficult to detect that victims are being redirected to an attacker-hosted landing page. The attackers have also revamped their landing pages with new university-specific banners, based on weather alerts or emergency notifications, to make them look more authentic.



“The changes in URL shorteners, linking and hosting practices described here make detection of TA407’s activities increasingly difficult for defenders and demonstrate the adaptability and innovation that have enabled this threat actor to drive billions of dollars in losses in terms of intellectual property theft and resale of stolen journal subscriptions,” said Proofpoint researchers, in an analysis this week.

Back-To-School Attacks
The attacks start with phishing messages to students with themed subject lines (such as “renewal of loaned items” or “library services”) purporting to come from the school administration or library. These messages contain links to spoofed login pages for resources associated with the targeted universities. Recipients who click the links are directed to a web page that looks identical or similar to the spoofed library resource.

After the victims enter their credentials, their web browsers are redirected to the next.php file, where the credentials are stored locally in the pass.txt file. The victim’s browser is then sent to the legitimate site being spoofed.

phishing email silent librarian

This attack method has been highly successful for Silent Librarian: In fact, in September researchers said that at least 20 new phishing domains were targeting more than 60 universities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States have cropped up.

More recently, researchers said that they observed campaigns ramping up over the past few weeks, with new Freenom domains appearing to host phishing pages (a full list of the more recent domains can be found here).

“Historically, the group has employed the use of a series of phishing origin points, abusing access first at one university and then another,” they said. “TA407 makes extensive use of Freenom domains to host credential phishing landing pages; the group then abuses compromised accounts at universities to phish users at other universities, compromising additional accounts and spreading from school to school.”

New Tricks
In a new technique not previously observed, researchers said that Silent Librarian cyberattackers have updated how they utilize URLs in their phishing emails to trick victims into clicking on the links.

phishing email silent librarian

Historically, the cyberattackers used shortening URL services (for initial redirection to phishing landing pages) such as the (now-discontinued) Google URL shortening service and .ir-based short URL services.

However, researchers say they have more recently observed “apparent experimentation” with university-based URL shorteners from universities that they have previously compromised. Researchers believe this is due to the discontinuation of Google’s goo.gl services.

Many organizations, especially universities, stand up their own URL shortening services to allow students and staff to share content (such as a long link in an academic journal or a paper hosted on a deep directory structure) easily without relying on third-party services like bit.ly, researchers told Threatpost.

Because of the nature of these services, the URL gives no clue as to the actual content of the link. That said, a link like [goo.gl/abc123] is more likely to set of red flags than one that comes from a school’s domain or known short URL service (i.e one that looks like this: [<the school’s domain>.edu/abc123]), Chris Dawson, threat intelligence lead at Proofpoint, told Threatpost.

“These services help to make fraudulent links appear legitimate to targeted users and mask their true destination, increasing the likelihood of a successful breach,” Dawson told Threatpost. “TA407’s use of shortened URLs demonstrates the adaptability that has enabled them to drive billions of dollars in losses in terms of intellectual property theft and resale of stolen journal subscriptions.” 

phishing email silent librarian

In another trick used in more recent campaigns, researchers said that Silent Librarian is also taking advantage of publicized downtime or weather alerts, among other events, to add credibility to the phishing landing page.

For example, in one spoofed landing page researchers observed weather notification banners that mimic a notification being used in the real login portal: “The awareness manifests in both the lure wording and/or landing page appearance,” researchers said. “However, Proofpoint researchers do occasionally observe what appears to be an outdated clone of a previous version of their target’s portal, suggesting either inconsistent updates or coincidental timing of clone updates.”

Looking ahead, researchers recommend that universities remain vigilant against these threats to prevent losses and protect valuable IP and personal information.

“Implementing two-factor authentication within publicly exposed systems can help mitigate overall attack risk and substantially increase the level of effort needed by threat actors to compromise university accounts,” said researchers."

The Attack
New Tricks
Kimsuky Group
Share this article:

Researchers warn that U.S. firms are being targeted with legitimate – but trojanized – documents that are often socially engineered to a tee.

Researchers have uncovered an ongoing, sophisticated malware campaign aiming at U.S.-based targets with an interest in nuclear deterrence, North Korea’s nuclear submarine program and North Korean economic sanctions.

The campaign, which researchers from Prevailion call “Autumn Aperture” and link with moderate confidence to the North Korea-based Kimsuky threat actors, sends victims trojanized documents via spear-phishing emails.

The campaign is highly sophisticated, using legitimate documents that the targets were likely expecting, which have been booby-trapped. In addition, the threat actors used anti-evasion tactics such as utilizing obscure file formats (including the Kodak FlashPix format), which make them harder to detect by antivirus products, researchers said.



Researchers did not specify the companies targeted or the specific type of malware variant linked to the campaign. When asked about the specific malware utilized in the campaign, they told Threatpost: “Unfortunately Prevailion was unable to find the payload associated with this campaign. We were able to determine that trojanized document was trying to pull down an executable HTML file. But could not find a sample to analyze. ”

The Attack
The researchers said that they had seen a slew of trojanized documents being spread throughout this past summer, with the most recent wave being sent around Aug. 20.

The emails containing the attachments were socially engineered to to mimic emails that were likely anticipated by victims. For instance, one malicious document was a conference speaker’s notes, sent after his presentation at a nuclear-deterrence summit.

autumn aperture 
One malicious document used in Autumn Aperture

Another was a report from a U.S. university affiliate discussing North Korea’s new ballistic missile submarine (SSB) capabilities; while yet another impersonated the U.S. Department of Treasury and sent a renewal notice for a sanctions license.

The most recent document associated with the campaign, modified on Aug. 20, was titled “NK new SSB shown with Kim 22-7-2019;” it featured a report on the construction of a new SSB facility. Document metadata shows that it was created by a U.S. based university affiliate and was modified by the threat actors.

When victims viewed the documents in an application, the malware would display a prompt to enable macros. Once macros were enabled, the document would then display the content while secretly installing malware onto the victims’ system.

“These threat actors’ [tactics, techniques and procedures] are evolving and continue to be refined with each new operation,” Danny Adamitis and Elizabeth Wharton, both with Prevailion, warned in a Wednesday post. “While this type of operation did require some user interaction (pressing the macro button), the malware would do the rest in the background, hidden from the victim.”

New Tricks
Threat actors also bolstered their campaign with new tricks that made the malicious documents more difficult to spot.

One newly added feature would enumerate the host machine and experiment with password-protecting certain documents. Autumn Aperture also added a new feature that called Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) — the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems — to determine if it was safe to obtain the next payload on the host machine. It did this by obtaining a list of running processes and services from WMI, then comparing that output to a list of known antivirus products.

In July, threat actors added a script to the dropper that would check for the presence of antivirus products from Malwarebytes, Microsoft (Windows Defender) and McAfee, as well as (starting in August) scripts to detect Sophos and Trend Micro.

And finally, in recent campaigns, threat actors embedded the malware in a Kodak FlashPix file format (FPX). FPX is a complex image file format intended for use with photographs.

According to VirusTotal testing, the FPX file format has a significantly lower detection rate than most, dropping the initial detection rate to eight out of 57 AV products; whereas the standard file format for photos, VBA, had an initial detection rate of  23 out of 57.

“This technique followed a wider trend that we are observing across multiple threat-actor groups, in which they socially engineer victims with an image rather than relying on an exploit,” researchers said. “Several actors are creating more robust droppers to better protect their tool sets and increase their chances of operating without discovery. These changes reflect a highly motivated threat actor, likely to continue performing operations.”

Kimsuky Group
The Kimsuky threat group, which was linked to the campaign, has been on the radar since 2018, and is known for targeting South Korean political organizations and think tanks. The APT in 2018 “renewed its arsenal with a completely new framework designed for cyber-espionage and used in a spear-phishing campaign,” according to Kaspersky researchers.

Kaspersky researchers also said that the Kimsuky group has extended its activities to include individuals and companies in the cryptocurrency exchanges sector, mainly in South Korea.

Researchers with Prevailion warned of future ongoing attacks, and said organizations should assess existing risk profiles, review emergency response plans and ensure that employees are educated.

“Given the broad scope of entities targeted by Autumn Aperture, there is an increased likelihood that a third party within an organization’s ecosystem is at risk of exposure,” they said."

Cobalt Dickens (a.k.a. Silent Librarian) is now actively targeting 380 universities, bent on stealing credentials and moving deeper into school networks.

Indicating a campaign of massive scale, at least 20 new phishing domains targeting more than 60 universities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States have cropped up, bent on lifting credentials from students heading back to school.

The domains are associated with a group of Iranian cyberattackers collectively known as Cobalt Dickens or Silent Librarian. As Threatpost recently reported in a post on the group’s attack tactics, the attackers are looking to use fake, library-themed landing pages to steal students’ credentials, then use those to steal and resell intellectual property, move laterally within organizations, conduct internal phishing and more.

New details from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers this week show that in total, Cobalt Dickens is actively targeting at least 380 universities in more than 30 countries. Many universities have been targeted multiple times, the firm said.



As Proofpoint previously pointed out, the attacks start with messages that contain links (with legitimate-looking URLs) to spoofed login pages for resources associated with the targeted universities. Recipients who click the links are directed to a web page that looks identical or similar to the spoofed library resource. After the victims enter their credentials, their web browsers are redirected to the next.php file, where the credentials are stored locally in the pass.txt file. The victim’s browser is then sent to the legitimate site being spoofed.

CTU’s analysis shows that Cobalt Dickens is not reinventing the wheel nor investing much when it comes to the tools it uses to carry this out: The new phishing domains were registered using the Freenom domain provider, which administers free top-level domains (TLDs); and the attackers are also using other free online services, including free certificates and publicly available code.

For instance, many of the domains use valid SSL certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt; and the public tools include the SingleFile plugin available on GitHub and the free HTTrack Website Copier standalone application, to copy the login pages of targeted university resources.

[Learn more about trending phishing lures on Threatpost’s recent podcast, available for download here.] 



“Metadata in a spoofed login page created on August 1 suggests that Cobalt Dickens sometimes uses older copied versions of target websites,” said CTU researchers, in a posting on Wednesday. “A comment left in the source code indicates it was originally copied on May 1, 2017. However, the university was targeted by numerous Cobalt Dickens operations, including the August 2018 and August 2019 campaigns.”

It’s worth noting that Cobalt Dickens has come under scrutiny by federal law enforcement before: In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the Mabna Institute and nine Iranian associates for compromising hundreds of universities to steal intellectual property and benefit financially.

“The threat actors have not changed their operations despite law enforcement activity, multiple public disclosures and takedown activity,” said CTU researchers.

CTU added that to protect students, universities can implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

“Implementing additional security controls like MFA could seem burdensome in environments that value user flexibility and innovation, single-password accounts are insecure,” the researchers noted."

Proofpoint’s senior director of the threat research team discusses the strange levels that attackers are going to in order to persuade victims to click on phishing messages.

Hackers aren’t just targeting infrastructure anymore – they’re actively playing on the emotions of people, whether it’s a consumer who desperately wants to lose weight to an employee who is nervous he will lose his job if he doesn’t do exactly what his boss says.

That’s according to Proofpoint’s 2019 Human Factor Report, released this week, which outlines the top social engineering tactics that attackers are using – including the most lucrative industries and victim types they’re looking at, the most-clicked type of spear-phishing and spam message (hint: it has to do with diet and mental enhancement), and how the social engineering threat landscape is changing in general.

Sherrod DeGrippo, the senior director of the threat research and detection team at Proofpoint, joins Threatpost editor Lindsey O’Donnell to swap stories about the craziest scams and phishing attempts that she’s seen – from swearword-riddled threats to sue victims, to real estate scams that have actually succeeded in swindling buyers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars – and how hackers are playing into victims’ emotions to get them to click on that malicious attachment or link.

Below is a lightly-edited transcript of the podcast.

Lindsey O’Donnell: Hi, welcome back to the Threatpost Podcast. This is Lindsey O’Donnell with Threatpost and I’m here today with Sherrod DeGrippo, the senior director of the threat research and detection team over at Proofpoint: Sherrod, thanks for joining me today. It’s nice to be speaking to you again.

Sherrod DeGrippo: Thanks for having me, Lindsey. I always love talking with you. Thank you so much.

LO: So today we’re going to discuss the 2019 Human Factor Report, which was released by Proofpoint this week. The survey was really interesting. It was based on data collected over 18 months between 2018 and the first half of 2019. And you guys analyzed billions of messages daily and hundreds of millions of domains, to look at the ways in which actors are increasingly exploiting what you call the “human factor.” So Sherrod first of all, can you tell us about the “human factor?” I mean, what does that human factor mean in the context of cybersecurity and in the context of attacks?

SD: I think that with the human factor, what we’re really talking about is getting beyond the technical protection mechanisms of the system. So when you think of a system protection, you think of your perimeter defenses, you think of patches… all those things that are the traditional foundations of information security – have been leveraged really effectively to protect systems in organizations’ environments. And what we focus on now is the tactics that are used to get around those technical defenses. And a lot of times they require a human factor, which means it requires human intervention of some kind. That’s something that we focused on really heavily because as you said, we process over 5 billion emails a day. And so that’s a lot of data and it’s a huge opening for threat actors to get in and all they need is a human to make a small action of some kind to interact with them, and they can compromise that business potentially.

LO: Right. And I think that’s really a great point, especially because with this kind of emerging modern threat landscape, we’re really seeing it becoming more increasingly people-centric with attacks that are focusing more on employees and people and identities, as opposed to infrastructure. And we see that every week with phishing emails being sent to employees, really playing on emotions, giving a false sense of urgency into making different sorts of wire transfers or through other tactics. So I do think the report is really relevant. Taking a step back before looking at some of the key takeaways of this report, can you give us some background on social engineering? What do attackers look at when they’re crafting these emails, and trying to construct the perfect social engineering tricks?

SD: Oh, that’s a great question. So social engineering, I think, is something that in the information security industry, people love. It’s definitely of interest to me, it’s something that’s really important to Proofpoint. Essentially, what we find is that social engineering is getting a person to feel an emotion or take some kind of action. It’s evoking excitement or fear or comedy to sort of get someone to take that action and help the threat actor out with whatever they’re doing. Social engineering has been really, really important for getting technical threats onto machines, you know, since the beginning of time, but essentially now humans have so much access and so much capability. If you’re able to get a human to take a step for you, say clicking something, then as a threat actor, that makes the job a lot easier, because you don’t have to worry about all the system protections that might be in place. A great example of that is in 2018, the most effective lure for phishing was something called brain food. We wrote a blog on that last year. Essentially, it’s one of those kind of smart drugs that basically says it’ll make you into some kind of super genius if you take it. So it’s pretty basic pharmaceutical spam, but it was the most effective phishing lure that we saw last year. And I think that a big reason that it was so effective was, one, people were clicking on it because they were interested. But people were sharing it around and forwarding it to their friends, because it seemed interesting or shocking, or something that they might find that their friends were interested in. So we were actually finding that social engineering was being shared through both email, social media and things like that; making that phishing lure even more effective than it would have been otherwise.

LO: I’ve definitely seen those kinds of diet and mental enhancement types of spam just filtering through my own inbox so I can see why they would be dangerous. And I know you guys said that they were the most clicked lure with – what was it – like 1.6 clicks per message or something like that? Right?

SD: Right it was over a click and a half per message. And what’s interesting about that is that means that people are either clicking on multiple links in the same message, or they’re forwarding the message around so that more than one person is clicking within the same message. And that’s fascinating that what’s essentially a phishing email is able to get such a high click rate. That’s the threat actors’ dream.

LO: That’s an extremely high click per message rate. Were there any other lures that you guys found were extremely effective like that one?

SD: Sure. So that was really effective in 2018. But now in 2019, what we’re seeing is that people love to click on a cloud storage or services link. They love DocuSign. They love Microsoft Cloud services. They love a Dropbox, they love a Box link. We’re finding that those threat actors are relying on the cloud services because people have gotten used to clicking on things from SharePoint or a Google-hosted document. So people just click on those, they trust them. So if you can design a lure that’s leveraging one of those services, those have become really, really effective in 2019.

LO: Yeah, those can definitely be tricky as well. I had a question too about the victims of social engineering and of these phishing lures. I know in the report, you guys talked about, as you call them, “very attacked people” – these people or employees or even just regular consumers that are being targeted, that you were observing in the research. And I wanted to know if you could break down what the different types of victims were, because one thing that stuck out to me in the report was that only a few years ago, it seemed like the C-Suite and the top execs were largely at risk for malspam campaigns or from malicious emails. But this most recent report shows that that’s not necessarily the case anymore for high profile individuals. I think you guys found that it was only 7 percent of executive emails were a part of the report. So could you really break down the most common victims you’re seeing for social engineering?

SD: Sure. So for very attacked people, that concept is a big focus for us at Proofpoint. It’s something that we developed internally at Proofpoint where we started seeing that certain types of people with certain kinds of access and certain titles, were getting higher amounts of targeted attacks, or higher amounts of attacks in general, than other people in the organization. And there’s this idea, I think that instantly people think, “Oh, you know, my C-level executives, my C-suite, that’s who I need to protect. That’s who has the power. That’s who the threat actors are going to go after.” But that isn’t actually what we found. The most important people in your organization from a hierarchical perspective are not actually the ones that are the most attacked. And a lot of the reason for that is, the people that typically have more of a public presence, they don’t tend to publish their emails, they don’t tend to have a lot of publicly accessible contact information that threat actors can use. But everybody has group emails, such as support, or HR or billing, that go into their organizations. Another is a lot of people in positions that are senior, but not necessarily executive, sometimes have larger public presences. They’re doing public speaking, they’re publishing reports, they may be in a recruiting role. And so they have contact information that’s much more accessible. So we’re finding that the threat actors are going after the profiles, either on social media on things like published reports in the particular industry, if they’re well known, and the threat actors are savvy at finding those connections, tracing them back, finding the people to attack and it’s typically not those in the C-Suite. The concept of just sending a massive email campaign – It’s just not what the sophisticated threat actors do. Like you said there’s only 7 percent of executive emails that are available online – executives are keeping them hidden. But people a little bit further down, they’re trying to build their profiles, build their brands, they’re much more accessible, and the threat actors are finding them.

LO: Like you said, the combination of having social media now and then also, those larger groups for support within companies is almost like the perfect opportunity for these hackers to kind of swoop in and gather those emails or, contact information that they need to launch these attacks. What were some of the other top takeaways from the report that you wanted to highlight in particular, that might underscore some of the future trends of social engineering and of the human factor?

SD: Sure. So something that we’re finding is that a lot of sophisticated actors are doing really sophisticated campaigns, and a lot of times we’re seeing marketing companies being leveraged. I think that marketing was one of the top-attacked verticals in the report that you’ll see. And what that means is those marketing companies, they hold such incredible data, such as all of your customers’ names, titles, locations, maybe work habits. And so if you can compromise one of those marketing companies that sends email on your behalf, you can very easily as a threat actor, find out who’s more likely to click on things, you can send very targeted campaigns. For example, I saw one recently, that was to an electronics company, and it was sent to their support address, and it had very specific subject lines detailing new products that that company was releasing. And so it would say something like “I have a problem with the name of the new product” in the subject line. And the body of course talks about a problem they’re having. Those are sent from spoofed email addresses for marketing companies. A lot of times marketing companies are safe listed in receiving for organizations because they know “hey, that’s my marketing company. We want to get the emails that they send.” But threat actors are leveraging those marketing companies and their brands, as well as reaching them to get to their sender lists and names and sending out really targeted, really interesting threat campaigns to those those addresses.

LO: Right, I feel like that having that kind of marketing contact list too would be a gold mine for then, in turn, sending spear phishing emails to those contacts, too. So were there any other industries that you guys saw being targeted, in particular in 2019?

SD: Sure, we saw a lot of, in terms of the severity of the attacks, we saw a lot in things like real estate. And I think what’s so interesting about real estate, we publish blogs along that industry talking about that vertical and the threats to them. Real estate is a highly targeted industry. And one of the reasons we assume for that is, real estate typically deals with a lot of really quick high value transactions of funds. You need to pay your earnest money, you need to pay for an inspection, “oh, we forgot this $500 fee that we had to pay for closing costs.” There are really quick exchanges and transactions between multiple parties. And it’s easy to sort of slip in there as a threat actor and say, “Oh, you know, you forgot to pay this $500 transfer, go ahead and send the funds here.” Getting into a real estate organization is a really successful get for a threat actor if they can get inside those transactions and start siphoning off those little payments and fees that go through a lot of real estate agents.

LO: Right. I remember I think it was back in February or early 2019. There was some news story about a wire transfers scam that cost a homeowner more than $300,000 because of this type of situation. And, what they were saying was that part of the issue is that a lot of these real estate business deals are publicly listed too. So that makes it easier for potential attackers to really get in between the seller and the buyer and launch these attacks.

SD: I think that for most people, if you sit and think about, “hey, what’s an industry that I would want to try to exploit, that I would want to try to get in the middle of their transactions?” Real Estate’s a really good choice. Finance is another. That’s a top industry that we see targeted with malware. It’s huge to send malware into finance companies, because again, they’re moving money around, they have access to that kind of capability. And they don’t always know what’s being sent, where it’s being sent to. They get emails from customers that say “do this, do that click on this, I’ve got a problem.” And if you get what you think is a customer who’s upset, who wants your help, a lot of us take it very seriously. And we want to do the best we can in our jobs. And that’s what the threat actors are leveraging. That’s really the social engineering that comes into play.

LO: Yeah, I had another question around social engineering and scams, and that’s specifically about some of the new technologies that are being used. I don’t know if you saw this story. But last week, it was reported that there was a successful financial scam that was used via audio deep fake. So cyber criminals were able to create an impersonation of a chief executives’ voice and use that audio to fool his company into transferring a large sum of money to their bank account. So do you think that new technology like deepfake, like artificial intelligence will play a big future part in tricking victims into believing an attacker is legitimate? I mean, what role does that have in the human factor report as well?

SD: Oh, that’s a great question. So I absolutely do think that that will happen. And I think what we’ll start to see as those technologies continue to evolve, we’re going to see the threat actors who are sophisticated, become more and more capable of taking advantage of that. In general, what we see with commodity crimeware is threat actors who maybe aren’t the most technically sophisticated, there’s a spectrum. They’ll take bits and pieces of things that are already out there that are freely-available, and they’ll put together their campaigns based on bits and pieces of scripts or malware, or botnets, leveraging all of the things that are available to them to create a campaign, and as things like deepfakes and AI become more available, they will absolutely use that to do social engineering at scale. That’s really what we’re talking about, is when a threat actor thinks of an idea. They think of the social engineering aspect of it and then they start going out to find the technology that can help them do that social engineering, but do it at a scale that is big enough to win, is big enough to get them whatever their goal is, and also allows them to customize what they’re sending, so that they can send very customized, highly labor intensive threats to lots of individual people.

LO: I’m already on the lookout for suspicious types of emails. But when these new technologies come into play, when you have things like deepfake audio or AI, I think that makes it so much harder, and really raises the bar for threat detection on the consumer level.

SD: Absolutely. I think that that’s going to be something that’s going to have to be examined continually as we keep evolving those kinds of technologies. And when we talk about sophisticated threat actors, as I said, there’s a spectrum and there will always be those on the lower end of the spectrum, who are just waiting for the next thing to be more accessible and more available to them. But we see threat actors now doing things like sending an email, and then having the victim call them on the phone to get them out of band, to verify, for example, it might be a spoof that is spoofing your CEO and it says, “Hey, could you please call the banking institution at this number to verify that the account numbers that I need you to transfer it to?” And so then you take the victim and you get them out of email, and you get them on the phone. And that allows the threat actor to interact with them in a way that seems more personable seems more authentic. AI will allow them to continue to do that bigger and bigger and bigger at scale and more convincingly.

LO: I haven’t heard of that one yet. So that seems like it’s definitely going to be a tricky way to better impersonate the legitimate sender of these these emails. Are there any other tricks that users should watch out for when it comes to social engineering and in that vein, what can they do to really avoid phishing and spear phishing emails?

SD: Always training your users, getting them to understand that if they’re having a deeply emotional reaction to an email that’s coming in, whether it’s from their supervisor, their boss, or who they think might be a customer, to stop and think about it, to stop and verify it, because ultimately, that individual at your organization, they’re one of the biggest lines of defense to protecting your organization. You have to train them, you have to invest in them in the same way that you invest in your technical controls. They are part of the chain of protection. And if they’re one of the very attacked people that we talked about, they need extra help. They need extra technical controls and they need extra training. One of the things that I’ve seen in the past is leveraging things like big events, like the end of Game of Thrones was a huge one for creating lures. So they would say, you know, I have the unaired three episodes of the Last season of Game of Thrones. And if you want to see them before all your friends, click here and you can see a preview of what they’ll look like. Leveraging all of these kinds of pop culture events, social events, it’s really something that the threat actors are tuned into and are smart about. A couple of months ago – You know, I swore up and down that the new royal baby, Archie, by Meghan Markle, and Harry – I thought for sure somebody would use that. And we actually put in a rule in our technology to find anything leveraging the announcement of the royal baby for malware and to flag it for us. But that’s actually one that we did not see. And I was shocked.

LO: It would have been a good one for that.

SD: I know I was waiting and waiting because I’ve seen so many crazy lures out there from “I’m divorcing you, my divorce papers are attached” to you know, “I’ve stolen your identity or I’m going to sue you” – I’ve seen lures that are just full of curse words, cursing people out saying “I’m going to sue you click here to see the lawsuit.” I thought that baby, I really thought that it was going to be a hit.

LO: But I could definitely see how those examples would really play into the victims’ emotions too, especially if they’re kind of riddled with swear words or whatnot. And even this week, I’ve seen warnings about potential lures with this big Apple launch, seeing potential scams around that too. So seems like there’s an event every week and kind of a phishing scam or spear phishing scam that goes along with it.

SD: Absolutely. I’m excited to see now that you’ve mentioned it, if I know that the Apple event is today and they have just finished, if you know we see anything leveraging that brand leveraging the new announced products and we see that sort of stuff all the time, as well as things like large sporting events, like the Super Bowl or the U.S. Open was last week. You know, they leverage those as best they can. But we also see some laziness. You know, we also see reuse or not really taking advantage of a big holiday because then that means that the threat actor can’t reuse their same lure in multiple countries. So if they talk about a French holiday, they won’t be able to use that same lure in the U.S. as as effectively. So sometimes we see a sort of lazy catch-all of just Microsoft stuff, Microsoft lures. So it really depends. It depends on how much work they want to put in.

LO: Right. And unfortunately, it seems like a lot of threat actors still do want to put in a lot of work and are finding success in launching a lot of these campaigns. So, Sherrod, thank you so much for coming on today and chatting about the top social engineering techniques and the overall 2019 human factor report.

SD: Of course, Lindsey, thanks so much for having me. It was great to talk with you.

Phishing for Apple
Share this article:

Telemetry for the first half of the year shows that Apple’s ecosystem is firmly in cybercriminals’ sights.

While macOS is often touted as “safer” on the cybersecurity front compared to Windows-based systems, cybercriminals are in fact increasingly targeting Apple’s ecosystem.

The number of attacks on macOS users through malicious and potentially unwanted programs has been increasing annually since 2012, and in 2018 it exceeded 4 million attacks, according to telemetry from Kaspersky released on Wednesday. The pace is staying steady so far this year: During the first half of 2019, the firm registered 1.8 million malware attacks on Macs.

The trojan downloader Shlayer, which downloads and installs various adware (mainly from the Bnodlero family), is the No. 1 threat seen taking aim at macOS, according to the report. It’s making use of people’s thirst for pirated content.



“If you try to search for sites where you can watch or download a popular movie or TV series for free, the very first search results will lead to resources that request you to update Flash Player in order to view content,” the firm explained. “It is these updates that contain Shlayer.”

With the exception of Shlayer, the rest of the top ten is filled out by various unwanted software belonging to the adware class, which display ads in system notifications, web page banners, search results pages, the browser and so on.



The adware samples making the rounds include Bnodlero, which installs ad extensions into a browser, and changes the default search engine and homepage. In addition, it can download and install extra adware. The Pirrit adware family meanwhile goes even further and installs a proxy server on the victim’s machine to intercept traffic from the browser. And, the Cimpli adware uses advanced stealth tactics, such as becoming purposely inactive if it detects an installed security solution in macOS.

Two other malware families that were seen attacking macOS in the first half of the year include a trojan called Spynion and another trojan, Vidsler.

The former is distributed along with several free macOS apps, mainly from sites such as MacUpdate, VersionTracker and Softpedia.

“While the app is being installed on the victim’s computer, a malicious component is downloaded and installed,” according to the report. “The Spynion’s main objective is to monitor user activity on the network and transfer intercepted confidential data to the attackers’ servers. The trojan also has backdoor functionality, i.e., it allows attackers to remotely connect to the user’s macOS.”

Vidsler meanwhile is distributed via banner ad links, under the pretext of requiring the user to update video codecs or download a new version of a video player.

“In terms of functionality, Vidsler is similar to Shlayer: It downloads, installs, and runs other software, most often from the FkCodec AdWare family,” Kaspersky explained.

New variants that have appeared this year include a previously unknown macOS malware from the North Korea-linked APT known as Lazarus Group, which attacked the financial sector earlier this year, the company said.

“An extremely dangerous (but also an extremely rare) threat is a targeted attack on macOS and iOS users, mainly business users,” according to the report. “Several well-known cybercriminal groups are currently working to develop malware for these operating systems, but the likelihood that a random user will be the target of such programs is extremely small. However, if you work in a financial institution, such as, for example, a bank, and your MacBook or iPhone is a corporate device, then the chances that you will be targeted increase considerably.”

Geographically speaking, the top three most-targeted countries remained the same between 2018 and 2019: The United States came in first place (24.4 percent), Germany came in second (14.6 percent), and France came in third (12.4 percent).

Phishing for Apple IDs
Beyond malware, Kasperksy also detected nearly 6 million phishing attacks on macOS users in the first half of 2019. Of these, 11.80 percent targeted corporate users.

“The data that has been collected over the last four years suggests that the number of phishing attacks on macOS users is definitely growing, and quite rapidly at that,” according to the report. “While in 2015 we registered a total of 852,293 attacks, in 2016 this figure grew by 86 percent to over 1.5 million, and in 2017 it skyrocketed to 4 million. In 2018, the number of attacks continued to grow, crossing the 7.3 million mark. At this point we can see that during the first half of 2019 alone, 5.93 million attacks were committed, which means that the number of attacks may exceed 16 million by the end of the year if the current trend continues.”

The phishing pages visited by MacOS users most often pretended to be banking services (39.95 percent), the second popular being global internet portals (21.31 percent) and social networks came in third in 2019 (12.3 percent).

There are also rafts of fake web pages that mimic Apple’s official pages or simply mention the brand.

“The attackers continue to mainly target Apple IDs, which are the users’ key to gaining access to Apple’s infrastructure,” according to the report. “Apple IDs are relatively easy to monetize. For example, they can be sold to other criminals. Perhaps the theft of this type of data is now the most dangerous threat macOS users face, in terms of the balance between the probability of the attack and the damage in the event of its success. Moreover, our statistics show that this type of attack is likely to be on the rise in the near future.”

Links to these sites are usually sent in emails that allegedly come from Apple Support. The recipient is threatened that their account will be locked unless they click the link and log in to confirm the information that has been specified in their profile. In another tactic, the email might thank the user for purchasing an Apple device or app on the App Store. The customer is then invited to learn more about the product (or cancel the purchase) by clicking a link that leads to a phishing page. Here, the victim is required to enter their Apple ID login and password, which, of course, will be sent to the attackers.

The countries with the largest share of unique macOS users who experienced phishing attacks in the first half of the year were Brazil (30.87 percent), India (22.08 percent), and France (22.02 percent)."
Email Phishing,"Half of Android Handsets Susceptible to Clever SMS Phishing Attack

Attack Specifics
Attack Scenarios
Share this article:


Researchers say an attacker could send a rogue over-the-air provisioning message to susceptible phones and route all internet traffic through a hacker-controlled proxy.

Over half of all Android handsets are susceptible to a clever over-the-air SMS phishing attack that could allow an adversary to route all internet traffic through a rogue proxy, as well as hijack features such as a handset’s homepage, mail server and directory servers for synchronizing contacts and calendars.

Researchers at Check Point said Samsung, Huawei, LG and Sony handsets are “susceptible” to the phishing ploy.

“In these attacks, a remote agent can trick users into accepting new phone settings that, for example, route all their internet traffic through a proxy controlled by the attacker,” Check Point researchers Artyom Skrobov and Slava Makkaveev wrote in a blog post outlining their research on Wednesday.


Check Point said the attack vector was reported to handset makers in March and so far Samsung and LG have released fixes to address what researchers are calling a “phishing flow.” Huawei told Check Point its next-generation of handsets (Mate series or P series) will be updated to mitigate against such an attack.

“Sony refused to acknowledge the vulnerability, stating that their devices follow the [Open Mobile Alliance Client Provisioning] OMA CP specification,” wrote researchers.

Half of Android Handsets Open to Clever SMS Phishing Attack 

Attack Specifics
The attacks are based on over-the-air (OTA) provisioning, a tool used by cellular network operators to deploy network-specific settings to a new phone joining their network, describes Check Point. “However, as we show, anyone can send OTA provisioning messages,” Skrobov and Makkaveev wrote.

Researchers said the weak point in the OTA provisioning is tied to the industry standard approach, called OMA CP, which affords limited authentication between sender and handset.

“A recipient cannot verify whether the suggested settings originate from his network operator or from an imposter,” researchers wrote. Vulnerable handsets “allow users to receive malicious settings via such weakly-authenticated provisioning messages.”

Attack Scenarios
In a hypothetical attack, an adversary would send an OMA CP message via specialized equipment, which includes a GSM modem that could cost as little as $10. Next, the attacker sends a specially crafted binary SMS message to either a specific target or a range of phone numbers.

Researchers said, assuming that at least some of the recipients are gullible enough to accept a CP without challenging its authenticity, the OMA CP message allows the modification of the following settings over-the-air:

MMS message server
Proxy address
Browser homepage and bookmarks
Mail server
Directory servers for synchronizing contacts and calendar
In one attack scenario, involving a Samsung phone, researchers created an OMA CP message that if “accepted” by the user would route internet traffic through a proxy of the researcher’s choosing.

“We emphasize that there is no authenticity check for the attacker to overcome: all that is needed is for the user to accept the CP,” they wrote.

In other attack scenarios involving Huawei, LG or Sony phones an adversary needs to know the victims’ Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number. IMSI numbers are similar to an internet protocol address. Each phone has a unique IMSI number that is private. However Check Point researchers said they were easily able to identify a target’s IMSI number using a reverse IMSI lookup service.

“Reverse IMSI lookups are cheaply available via commercial suppliers. A rogue Android application can read the user’s IMSI number via the standard API ((TelephonyManager)getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE)).getSubscriberId()– as long as the application has the permission permission.READ_PHONE_STATE. Over a third of all Android apps released in the last three years already require this permission, so it wouldn’t raise any suspicion,” researchers wrote.

Researchers said the proof-of-concept attacks were performed on the Huawei P10, LG G6, Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and a range of Samsung Galaxy phones, including S9."

An ongoing campaign is hosting its phishing landing pages on enterprise-class public cloud storage services — a nascent trend meant to throw defenders off.

Recent phishing campaigns have been spotted boosting their anti-detection efforts by using Amazon Web Services to host their landing pages. It’s a sign of a nascent trend towards using public cloud storage, according to researchers.

The attackers are also layering on various obfuscation techniques, including multibyte XOR encoding, according to the analysis, released by Proofpoint on Thursday.

“Threat actors, and most recently phishers, have been able to evade detection by using well-known and trusted consumer cloud, social networking and commerce services to host malicious phishing kits,” the researchers said in a posting on Thursday. “Some actors have now graduated from using consumer cloud storage such as Google Drive and Dropbox to more enterprise-class public cloud storage providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, and continue to use various encoding techniques in their landing web pages via JavaScript in order to evade detection.”



In late July, a targeted phishing campaign kicked off using the branding and email formatting of DocuSign. An email asks a target to sign a document electronically. If the visitor enters their information on the DocuSign landing page, they will then be redirected to a lookalike of the webmail service they indicated, and another phishing landing will try to steal the credentials.

The DocuSign campaign has no particular vertical targeting, researchers said, but the phishing lure was only sent to a small group of people across various organizations.

“Visually, it appears as a fairly standard phishing lure for documents purporting to be shared via DocuSign,” researchers said. “While the landing page for the credential phish also convincingly resembles DocuSign in branding and overall format, it is actually a phishing template that has been commonly used over the past few years.”

What’s not so common is the fact that the landing page was hosted on Amazon S3. According to Proofpoint, this is a continuation of adversaries’ growing interest in public cloud buckets. Proofpoint has also recently documented threat actors abusing Microsoft’s Azure Blob Storage, it said.

The page uses JavaScript encoding, according to the analysis, with multiple layers. “A large array of hex-encoded strings which, when decoded, appears to include some ciphertext as well as a few strings, and then an eval statement to decode the encoded blob,” researchers wrote. “The encoding and variable names will often change with each deployment of the landing.”

Once decoded, it becomes clear that the phishing kit pulls remote resources from multiple websites, which have TLS certificates from Let’s Encrypt – they all trace back to a user registered as “phasephaser[@]yandex.com”.

“The actor engaging in this activity is not new to hosting on AWS, as we have observed it in similar low-volume campaigns throughout the year,” the researchers said. “All non-AWS domains have utilized Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates, and most appear to be registered with Russian domain registration services. While all phishing was hosted on AWS during this period, in some cases the actor used other public cloud infrastructure to host specific resources for the landing pages.”

Use of enterprise cloud services is still a fledgling technique, Proofpoint researchers said, and while Amazon has been responsive and “especially vigilant” in taking down abusive accounts, they warned that defenders should be aware that cloud storage is growing attack tool."

Code Reuse Plagues the Criminal World Too
Share this article:

The vulnerable kits also offer a point of entry to compromise legitimate website servers.

They say it’s a dog-eat-dog world out there, but in cybercrime terms, perhaps it should be called a “phish-eat-phish” situation. Researchers recently discovered that several widely used phishing kits harbor vulnerabilities that can be exploited by other criminals to hijack operations – and commandeer any freshly stolen data.

Worse, compromised kits can be used as a pivot point to infiltrate legitimate websites that have been compromised to host the kits in the first place.

Researchers at Akamai have found holes in the installation stage of some phishing kits that would allow a second attacker to infiltrate and upload additional files, including any sort of executable code – as well as simply take over the operations of the kit.



“The kits included basic vulnerabilities due to flimsy construction or reliance on outdated open-source code …and web application vulnerabilities,” wrote Larry Cashdollar, Akamai researcher, in a posting on Wednesday, adding that criminals can scan for and discover vulnerable kits, which are often uploaded to a compromised WordPress or Joomla blog.

Unfortunately, these buggy kits are also a perfect entry point for a hacker to gain access to the back end of an unwitting, legitimate web server.

“The real risk and concern in this situation goes to the victims – the server administrators, bloggers and small-business owners whose websites are where phishing kits like these are uploaded,” Cashdollar explained, noting that it’s a bit of double jeopardy situation; site owners may get in trouble for hosting a phishing site (even if inadvertently), and then may find their entire server infrastructure compromised on top of that.

“They’re getting hit twice and are completely unaware of the serious risk these phishing kits represent,” Cashdollar said. “Attackers compromising these kits using these vulnerabilities could gain additional footholds on the web server. One PHP shell and an improperly secured script ran by CRON is all an attacker needs to take over the whole server.”

Code Reuse Plagues the Criminal World Too
The main source of the problem is the slapdash way many of these kits are constructed, according to the firm’s research. Many of the phishing kits that Akamai looked at were found to come pre-packaged with the same types of file-upload vulnerabilities – a direct result of code-sharing.

“The common thread between each kit is the usage of class.uploader.php, ajax_upload_file.php, and ajax_remove_file.php, in a number of different naming conventions,” Cashdollar said. “The code used in these files comes from a GitHub repository that was last updated in 2017, and the project is just a collection of file upload scripts for PHP. The file names themselves are not important. The risk is the code being copied from GitHub and pasted between kits.”

The vulnerability lies in the fact that code for the uploader script and the uploader class file common across the kits don’t check for file type. So, a user could upload executable code to the web root, and if the upload path doesn’t already exist, the uploader class file will create it.

Also, “the code in the file remove script doesn’t sanitize user input from ‘..’ allowing directory traversal, enabling a user to delete arbitrary files from the system if they’re owned by HTTPd,” explained Cashdollar.

Code reuse is of course a normal part of development in both the legitimate and the cybercrime worlds, with open-source components widely adopted in an effort to not reinvent the wheel when it comes to basic functions.

The difference is that in the legitimate arena, “when problems are discovered, they’re usually quickly addressed and corrected,” Cashdollar said. “Criminals do not care, nor do they actually control their code once released, so there is no real fix for vulnerabilities like these.”

Fake Landing Page
Tricks and Tactics
Share this article:

The campaign, codenamed “Bad Tidings,” has sought out victims’ credentials with clever fake landing pages pretending to be the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Interior’s e-Service portal.

An ongoing three-year-old phishing campaign has been targeting the credentials of Saudi Arabian government agencies — with a financially motivated actor the likely culprit.

The campaign, code-named “Bad Tidings,” has siphoned victims’ credentials by pretending to be the Kingdom’s Ministry of Interior’s e-Service portal, known as “Absher.” The recent emails have targeted four government entities: the Ministry of Interior, Saudi Government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Labor and Social Development – as well as the Saudi British Bank.

While the campaign has been ongoing since November 2016, researchers with Anomali said that in the past few months, the number of phishing landing pages has suddenly spiked.

“Anomali and [Saudi Telecom Company] believe the Bad Tidings campaign’s heavy focus on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)’s government agencies electronic services is reflective of information-gathering operations employed by a financially-motivated actor or group attempting to steal and monetize personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data,” researchers said in a Tuesday post.

Fake Landing Page
Since it first started in 2016, the campaign has used a total of 95 unique phishing host names to target its victims.

These were created as part of the campaign to impersonate the aforementioned Absher, which represents close to 60 percent of the Saudi-related phishing sites. The e-Service portal helps users with employment, passports, civil affairs, traffic services and more.

saudi arabia phishing campaign

The phishing landing pages in the campaign would typically contain two web pages: A fake homepage, and a login page.

The fake login pages appear to display the legitimate account access portal for Absher – however, when users provide their user ID and password, they are redirected to the initial phishing landing page without logging into the intended resource.

“Typically, at this stage the phishers have stolen the user’s credentials and are likely to sell them on underground markets or use them to impersonate the victim to commit fraudulent actions,” researchers said.

Tricks and Tactics
The attackers have used multiple spoofing techniques to disguise the fraudulent sites, researchers said.

“We have observed the attackers creating sites using either a single or combined technique of punycode-based spoofing attacks, typosquatting or sub-domain spoofing attacks,” researchers said.

Researchers said that to trick users, the websites that were created were using slightly misspelled domain names (a technique called “typosquatting,” which registers domains that can be confused for the legitimate site or brand name by incorporating hard-to-spot spelling or grammatical errors); subdomain spoofing, using alternative top level domains (TLDs) (i.e., near-identical URL names that use something other than the legitimate gov.sa suffix), or punycode-based sites to masquerade as the real portal. Punycode is a method of representing International Domain Names in local language characters, which are normally limited by letters or hyphens when supported by DNS.

“For example, the Absher portal is a web page located underneath the website https://www.moi.gov.sa/; however, malicious actors have appropriated the brand name ‘Absher’ to create typosquatting domains with misspellings and wrong TLDs e.g. abshr[.]xyz or simply wrong TLDs e.g. absher[.]space,” said researchers.

 Moving forward, researchers said they expect the campaign to continue targeting Saudi government e-services using phishing attacks, either via email or text message.

“Online government portals offering citizen services remain attractive targets, as they store vast amounts of personal and sensitive information in a centralized location and if compromised, can provide malicious actors with enough data for resale on underground markets or to commit fraudulent actions such as identity theft,” the researchers said."

'Jmail Breaker' Attack Flow
The Adversary
Share this article:

The Jmail Breaker attack leverages an old vulnerability in Joomla! along with a newly found flaw in the mail module.

SECOND UPDATE

Editor’s Note: It has come to our attention that Check Point’s findings are being questioned by Joomla! and others in the open-source ecosystem. Our story accurately reflects Check Point’s report — but it’s clear that the news isn’t about Jmail or the vulnerability (which is at least three years old), but rather that an attacker has set up a mass phishing infrastructure using an old attack pattern and is carrying out a campaign. Threatpost has reached out to Check Point again to get details as to how prolific the attack is and who the targets are, etc. and will update the post accordingly. Joomla! meanwhile has issued a statement on what it says are inaccuracies on the technical side of Check Point’s report. That statement can be found here. 

SAN FRANCISCO — A fresh campaign from a known adversary is using a known flaw in the popular Joomla! CMS platform to carry out a large-scale phishing and spam operation, according to researchers.

According to Check Point Research, a cybercriminal known as Alarg53 is using Jmail for phishing and spam, and has even implemented a fully fledged backdoor infrastructure within the platform to carry out those first two activities at scale.

“Indeed, by implementing simple manipulations on the User‐Agent header on HTTP requests, one can manipulate the platform and override the existing Jmail service,” explained the researchers, in findings released at the RSA Conference 2019.

For its part, Joomla! initially gave Threatpost a short statement: “The Joomla Project takes security very seriously and closely cooperates with reports to fix reported issues as fast as possible. As Check Point however did not reach out to us upfront, like it’s best practice in the security industry, we can’t comment or fix an issue that has not been published yet.”

It now has issued a longer statement discounting the Jmail override statement by Check Point.

‘Jmail Breaker’ Attack Flow
According to Check Point, the adversary first exploited a known object injection remote code-execution (RCE) flaw in Joomla! to inject code into the User‐Agent header field in HTTP requests.



“The attacker injects a base64 string in the User‐Agent field. The PHP code then downloads the files and stores them in a specific path,” Check Point noted. “Once decoded, it is transformed into PHP code that runs on the victim’s machine. The code tries to download specific files from Pastebin and stores them in a designated path.”

That path happens to be “./libraries/joomla/jmail.php; in the recent campaign, Check Point said, adding that it found that the HTML file stored there contains PHP code with two major sections that serve two functionalities – sending mail and uploading files.

“Once downloaded and stored, the file actually overrides the current Joomla Jmail service,” the researchers said (note– Joomla! discounts this, noting in its statement that the file “does not ‘override’ the core JMail class.”

Check Point continued, “From now on, this file is actually an infrastructure in which the attacker can upload files and send mail for his own purposes. Based on our threat actor’s activity on the web, it seems this infrastructure is being used for phishing and mail spamming.”

Check Point has dubbed the attack “Jmail Breaker,” and researchers said that they expect it to be used by other adversaries in other attacks.

“Using an old Joomla Object Injection vulnerability, the attacker has managed to create an interesting chain that eventually can be leveraged for monetization through a phishing and spamming infrastructure,” researchers noted. “We predict that we will soon see evidence of such spamming methodologies in the near future.”

The Adversary
The threat actor, Alarg53, is known for defacing websites by replacing their home pages with a “Hacked by Alarg53” message instead, according to Check Point. As such, he has primarily made his name as a hacktivist, hacking sites on the basis of ideology.

However, he gained notoriety in 2017 by hacking Stanford University servers via a WordPress vulnerability.

“At first, it was thought to be just another [defacement] attack, but within a few hours, two PHP files were uploaded to the relevant servers enabling them to send large amounts of spam mail,” Check Point researchers explained. “[From there], he started to monetize his activities through cryptomining attacks and [a] phishing infrastructure.”

His attacks have been global, affecting victims in France, India, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.; industries affected include finance, banking and government, according to Check Point.

Now, using the Jmail Breaker approach, his game has changed to enable mass monetization campaigns, Check Point said.

“Whereas Alarg53 is a known hacker that has managed to hack more than 15,000+ sites, this time he has hit the big time as his attacks have evolved to include a significant and high‐scale backdoor and phishing infrastructure,” according to Check Point.

Threatpost received several comments on this posting from Joomla! (see comments section below) about the Jmail issue, disputing the veracity of Check Point’s findings. After reaching out to Check Point and speaking to the researchers, we have updated this post to make it clear that the attacker in the campaign has exploited a known bug, not a previously unknown issue in Jmail.

Phishing emails target a bank’s users with malware – and make their landing page look more legitimate with fake Google reCAPTCHAs.

A recently-discovered phishing scam was found peddling malware, using a new technique to mask its malicious landing page: A fake Google reCAPTCHA system.

The campaign targeted a Polish bank and its users with emails, said researchers with Sucuri. These emails contained a link to a malicious PHP file, which eventually downloaded the BankBot malware onto victims’ systems.

This Android-targeted banking malware, first discovered in 2016, is a remotely controlled Android banking trojan capable of stealing banking details by impersonating bank apps, looking at text messages and displaying unsolicited push notifications. In this specific case, BankBot was scooping up various private data, including SMS and call logs, contacts and location, researchers said.



“During a recent investigation, we discovered a malicious file related to a phishing campaign that targeted a Polish bank,” said Luke Leak with Sucuri, in a Thursday analysis. “This campaign employed both the impersonation and panic/bait techniques within an email in order to lure victims into downloading banking malware.”

 

The emails asked victims for confirmation for a recent transaction, along with a link to a malicious PHP file. Researchers said that users of the bank who saw the email would likely be alarmed that it was asking for confirmation of an unknown transaction, prompting them to click the malicious link.

“This makes it a bit more unique from the phishing content that we typically find, which often consists of a PHP mailer and file(s) used to construct the phishing page itself,” said Leak. “In most cases, it’s just a replica of the login page for whatever institution they are targeting.”

When the victims clicked on the link, the malicious PHP file would send them a fake “404 error” page. The PHP code then loaded a fake Google reCAPTCHA using a combination of HTML elements and JavaScript. reCAPTCHA is Google’s authentication mechanism  used for distinguishing bots from true site users.

The fake reCAPTCHA looks real, and makes victims feel as though the landing page is legitimate, researchers said.

“This page does a decent job at replicating the look of Google’s reCAPTCHA, but since it relies on static elements, the images will always be the same unless the malicious PHP file’s coding is changed,” said Leak. “It also doesn’t support audio replay, unlike the real version.”

google recaptcha phishing scam The PHP code then determined which form of malware to download on the victim’s device. If the victim uses Android, it would drop a malicious .apk, and if not, it downloaded a .zip dropper.

Besides “BankBot,” the Android malware is also labeled as “Banker” and “Artemis” on VirusTotal by varying anti-virus programs.

“Shortly after the discovery of the apps trojanized with BankBot on Google Play in the beginning of 2017, we have confirmed that the malicious apps were derived from source code made public on underground forums in December 2016,” said ESET researchers, in an analysis of BankBot. “The public availability of the code has led to a surge in both the number and sophistication of mobile banking trojans.”

Phishing scams have continued to step up their game over the past year, with bad actors are continuously updating their methods to become trickier. That includes using new tactics like Google Translate or  custom fonts to make the scams seem more legitimate.

Leak said this type of phishing campaign “can cause serious headaches for website owners.”

“The malicious directories used in these campaigns are uploaded to a website after it has been compromised,” said Leak. “When dealing with this type of malware, it is important to delete the files contained in a complaint, however; we strongly encourage administrators to scan all other existing website files and database for malware as well. You’ll also want to update all of your passwords to prevent the attackers from accessing the environment again.”"

Researchers warn that the phishing campaign looks “deceptively realistic.”

A new phishing attack bent on stealing Facebook credentials has been spotted – and it’s turning researchers’ heads due to how well it hides its malicious intent.

Researchers with password management company Myki on Thursday said that attack reproduces a social login prompt in a “very realistic format” inside an HTML block. That block is embedded on a malicious website that victims must first be convinced to visit.

“We would like to raise awareness on the issue as quickly as possible, due to how realistic and deceptively convincing the campaign is,” Antoine Vincent Jebara, co-founder and CEO of Myki, said in an analysis of the scam.

Jebara investigated the scam after Myki password manager users started complaining that the manager was not auto-filling passwords on specific websites for popular domains. “Our investigation led us to suspect that these users might have visited a similar kind of phishing sites,” he said.

A bad actor was able to design a very realistic-looking social login popup prompt in HTML.  The status bar, navigation bar, shadows and content were perfectly reproduced to look exactly like a legitimate login prompt.

When a victim visits a malicious website (which an attacker could somehow convince them to visit, using social engineering tactics or otherwise), they would be prompted to log into their Facebook account via a false login prompt.

In a video demo outlined by researchers (see below) they showed a popup that appeared when they were trying to read an article on a site purporting to be The News Weekly Journal, which says “Login with Facebook to access the article.”

Researchers noted that the pop-up looks realistic to the point where users can interact with it, drag it and dismiss it the same way they would a legitimate prompt.

Once they fill out their username and password, that information is sent to the attacker, Jebara said.


“The only way to protect yourself from this type of attack is to actually try to drag the prompt away from the window it is currently displayed in,” he said. “If dragging it out fails (part of the popup disappears beyond the edge of the window), it’s a definite sign that the popup is fake.”

In general, as a precaution users should always drag popups away from their initial position to spot for abnormal behavior, he said.

“Most password managers are not sensitive to this kind of phishing attack as they look at the window URL to determine what password to auto-fill which in this case is not facebook.com,” according to the researchers.

Phishing attacks have continued to expand over the past year – and bad actors seems to be continuously updating their methods to become trickier, from using Google Translate to custom fonts.

According to a recent Proofpoint “State of the Phish” report, 83 percent of respondents experienced phishing attacks in 2018 – up 5 percent from 2017.  That may not come as a surprise. In just the last year phishing has led to several massive hacks – whether it’s hijacking Spotify users’ accounts or large data breaches like the December San Diego Unified School District breach of 500,000."

Phishing Scams on the Rise

A tricky two-stage phishing scam is targeting Facebook and Google credentials using a landing page that hides behind Google’s translate feature.

UPDATE

Recently-discovered phishing emails scoop up victims’ Facebook and Google credentials and hides its malicious landing page via a novel method – Google Translate.

The phishing campaign uses a two-stage attack to target both Google and Facebook usernames and passwords, according to researchers at Akamai who posted a Tuesday analysis. But in a tricky twist of events, the scam also evades detection through burying its landing page in a Google Translate page –  meaning that victims sees a legitimate Google domain and are more likely to input their credentials.

“When it comes to phishing, criminals put a lot of effort into making their attacks look legitimate, while putting pressure on their victims to take action,” Larry Cashdollar, with Akamai, said in a Tuesday post. “This is an interesting attack, as it uses Google Translate, and targets multiple accounts in one go.”

Google Credentials
Cashdollar said that he first noticed the attack on Jan. 7 when an email notification on his phone informed him that his Google account had been accessed from a new Windows device.

The message, titled “Security Alert,” features an image branded with Google that says “A user has just signed in to your Google Account from a new Windows device. We are sending you this email to verify that it is you.” Then, there’s a “Consult the activity” button below the message.

Interestingly, the message looked much more convincing in its condensed state on his mobile device, rather than on a desktop where the title of the email sender is more apparent, he said.

Upon closer look at the email, Cashdollar found that the “security alert” was sent from “facebook_secur[@]hotmail.com.”

That triggered two suspicions: Firstly, the email is from a Hotmail account, raising red flags – but also, the entire address had nothing to do with Google, instead referencing Facebook.

“Taking advantage of known brand names is a common phishing trick, and it usually works if the victim isn’t aware or paying attention,” he said. “Criminals conducting phishing attacks want to throw people off their game, so they’ll use fear, curiosity, or even false authority in order to make the victim take an action first, and question the situation later.”

When clicking on the “Consult the activity” button, Cashdollar was brought to a landing page that appeared to be a Google domain, prompting him to sign into his Google account.

However, one thing stuck out about the landing page – it was loading the malicious domain via Google Translate, Google’s service to help users translate webpages from one language to another.

phishing facebook google translate
Click to Expand.

Using Google Translate helps the bad actor hide any malicious attempts through several ways: Most importantly, the victim sees a legitimate Google domain which “in some cases… will help the criminal bypass endpoint defenses,” said Cashdollar.

Using Google Translate also means the URL bar is filled with random text. Upon further inspection of that text, victims could see the real, malicious domain, “mediacity,” being translated.

Luckily, “while this method of obfuscation might enjoy some success on mobile devices (the landing page is a near-perfect clone of Google’s older login portal), it fails completely when viewed from a computer,” said Cashdollar.

For those who fail to notice red flags regarding the landing page, their credentials (username and password) are collected – as well as other information including IP address and browser type – and emailed to the attacker.

“We are aware of the phishing attempts and have blocked all sites in question, on multiple levels,” a Google spokesperson told Threatpost. The spokesperson urged users to report them if they encounter a phishing site.

Facebook Credentials
However, the attack didn’t stop there. The attacker then attempts to hit victims twice, by forwarding them to a different landing page that purports to be Facebook’s mobile login portal as part of the attack.

These type of two-stage attacks appear to be on the rise as bad actors look to take advantage of victims who already fell for the first part of the scam, Cashdollar told Threatpost: “It seems this is becoming more common as the attacker knows they’ve gained your trust and try to steal additional credentials.”

Like the Google page, this Facebook landing page has some red flags. It uses an older version of the Facebook mobile login form, for instance.

“This suggests that the kit is old, and likely part of a widely circulated collection of kits commonly sold or traded on various underground forums,” said Cashdollar.

Despite these mistakes, the two stages of the phishing attack suggest a certain level of sophistication on the part of the attacker.

“It isn’t every day that you see a phishing attack leverage Google Translate as a means of adding legitimacy and obfuscation on a mobile device. But it’s highly uncommon to see such an attack target two brands in the same session,” he said.

Phishing Scams on the Rise
Phishing attacks have continued to grow over the past year – and this particular scam is only one example of how bad actors behind the scams are updating their methods to become trickier.

According to a recent Proofpoint report, “State of the Phish,” 83 percent of respondents experienced phishing attacks in 2018 – up 5 percent from 2017.

Other methods of phishing have increased as well. Up to 49 percent of respondents said they have experienced “voice phishing” (when bad actors use social engineering over the phone to gain access to personal data) or “SMS/text phishing” tactics (when social engineering is used via texts to collect personal data) in 2018. That’s up from the 45 percent of those who experienced these methods in 2017."

A spate of phishing emails with Word attachments deliver both the Gandcrab ransomware and Ursnif executable.

An array of phishing emails harboring Word attachments with embedded macros have been infecting systems with a deadly malware and ransomware duo.

The campaign, spotted by researchers at Carbon Black, has hit infected systems with a lethal attack combination that harvests credentials, gathers system and process information, and then encrypts data in order to extort payments from victims.

The attack originally came in via phishing emails that contained an attached Word document with embedded macros. The macro would then call an encoded PowerShell script and use a series of techniques to download and execute both a Ursnif malware strain and GandCrab ransomware variant.

The campaign appears to have begun targeting victims on Dec. 17, Carbon Black researchers told Threatpost.  There have been a couple of different pockets of activity observed each week since then, they said.

“The campaign appears to be ongoing, as we are seeing additional payloads being posted on pastebin.com that are almost identical to the payloads that were leveraged to data extracted from our analysis of these samples,” Jared Myers, senior threat researcher for Carbon Black, told Threatpost.

The Attack

The initial phishing emails included a Microsoft Word document to deliver the early stages of the attack.

“The overall attack leverages several different approaches, which are popular techniques amongst red-teamers, espionage-focused adversaries and large-scale criminal campaigns,” said Carbon Black researchers in a Thursday analysis.

GandCrab ransomware phishing
Click to Expand.

These documents contained a VBS macro that, once decompressed, totaled approximately 650 lines of code.  Interestingly, the vast majority of that was junk code – and once that was removed, there were about 18 lines of relevant code.

 From there, a PowerShell script was downloaded and executed, which then contacted a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) address requesting two strings of code: the DownloadString method, which ultimately downloads the GandCrab ransomware, and the DownloadData method, which eventually downloads the Ursnif malware strain.

GandCrab ransomware has been spotted in several campaigns over the past year, including hidden on legitimate but compromised websites, and infecting victims via a December sextortion campaign.

“The first payload that is downloaded via the DownloadString method…is a PowerShell one-liner that uses an ‘if’ statement to evaluate the architecture of the compromised system, and then downloads a additional payload from pastebin.com.  This additional payload is then executed in memory,” researchers said.

The  Ursnif executable meanwhile is downloaded from the DownloadData method, and then performs an array of malicious activities like credential harvesting, gathering system and process information, and deploying additional malware samples.

While no additional data is available on the number of victims in the campaign, Carbon Black researchers said that they have located roughly 180 Word document variants in the wild.

“We have not observed where any one particular malicious document was sent at a higher rate to potential victims than any other,” Myers told Threatpost. “However, the variants were presumably created in batches that were then sent to potential victims, so, depending on the effectiveness of the phishing emails, some may appear to be more successful than others."

The phishing campaign is using a new technique to hide the source code of its landing page – and stealing credentials from customers of a major U.S.-based bank.

An insidious phishing method evades detection using a never-before-seen technique that leverages custom fonts to cover its tracks.

Researchers at Proofpoint recently discovered an active credential harvesting phishing scheme. Once a victim has clicked on the initial phishing email, the resulting landing page looks like a login page for a major U.S. bank – but in reality the page is bent on stealing banking customers’ credentials, Chris Dawson, threat intelligence lead at Proofpoint, told Threatpost. The phishing kit uses custom web fonts to obfuscate the source code for the landing page – making it seem harmless.

“While encoded source code and various obfuscation mechanisms have been well documented in phishing kits, this technique appears to be unique for the time being in its use of web fonts to implement the encoding,” researchers at Proofpoint said in a Thursday analysis of the technique.

custom web fonts phishing 
Click to Expand.

Upon further analyzing the landing page, researchers were surprised to find that the source code of the page includes unexpectedly encoded display text – even when it has been copied and pasted into a text file.

Behind this trick are Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files, which are web font files created in an open format that delivers webpage fonts. The base64-encoded woff and woff2 files install a substitution cipher.

Essentially the substitution ciphers replace the expected alphabetical letters shown to the victim on the page (“abcdefghi…”) with other letters in the source code.

For potential victims looking at the page, the trick means their browser renders the ciphered text as plaintext – essentially making the true purpose of the landing page harder to detect.

These substitution functions are also identified in the CSS code for the landing page, differing from those used in other phishing kits, which are frequently implemented in JavaScript.

The phishing technique has one other trick up its sleeve: Using the images of the bank’s branding in scalable vector graphics format, so that the logo and its source do not appear in the source code. That sidesteps the process of linking to actual logos and other visual resources, which could potentially be detected by the impersonated brand.

Dawson said that the phishing kit was first observed being used in May 2018 – but it is possible that the kit appeared in the wild earlier. And, it’s still being used, with a number of active domains hosting the kit.

Potential victims as always should be extremely careful about clicking URLs and going directly to bank websites instead of following links.

“This is really just one more way in which threat actors are looking to hide their tracks,” Dawson told us. “Whether that is through a variety of code mechanisms or new novel ways of getting around detection, it’s all just a matter of being more effective.”"

The scam targets Netflix users and asks for payment information.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is warning of a new phishing scam reeling in Netflix customers and stealing their payment information.

According to a post published by the FTC, Wednesday, the spotted scam purports to be an email from Netflix. The email claims that the victim’s account was put on hold due to billing issues, and asks the victim to update their payment method.

“Police in Ohio shared a screenshot of a phishing email designed to steal personal information,” said Colleen Tressler, consumer education specialist with the FTC in a post. “The email claims the user’s account is on hold because Netflix is ‘having some trouble with your current billing information’ and invites the user to click on a link to update their payment method.”

In reality, the bad actors who sent the email are pocketing that payment information.

“We take the security of our members’ accounts seriously and Netflix employs numerous proactive measures to detect fraudulent activity to keep the Netflix service and our members’ accounts secure,” a spokesperson told Threatpost. “Unfortunately, scams are common on the internet and target popular brands such as Netflix and other companies with large customer bases to lure users into giving out personal information.”

In a post on its website, the company advised customers to “be aware of possible phishing attempts” including emails that imitate the company and ask for personal information.

Netflix will never ask for personal information to be sent via email, including payment information, social security number or account password, the company said.

“Netflix may email you to update this information with a link to our website, but be cautious of fake emails that may link to phishing websites,” said Netflix’s security page. “If you’re unsure about a link in an email, you can always hover your cursor over the link to see the linked URL at the bottom of most browsers.”

It’s not the first phishing scam involving Netflix by any means – earlier in June, researchers discovered a Netflix phishing scam that leads victims to sites with valid Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. Researchers said the bad actors behind those attacks will take advantage of unpatched installs or plugins, or weak passwords, to compromise usual-suspect CMS software, like WordPress or Drupal – and then create phishing sites that could be mistaken for real Netflix domains.

Phishing has led to several massive malicious hacks – whether it’s hijacking Spotify users’ accounts or massive data breaches like the recent San Diego Unified School District breach of 500,000.

Tressler suggested that email users avoid these types of scams by looking closely for “clues” like bad grammar or spelling.

“Other clues: Your name is missing, or you don’t even have an account with the company,” she said. “In the Netflix example, the scammer used the British spelling of ‘Center’ (Centre) and used the greeting, ‘Hi Dear.’ Listing only an international phone number for a U.S.-based company is also suspicious.”"
Email Phishing,"Gmail Glitch Enables Anonymous Messages in Phishing Attacks

A glitch in the UX in Gmail allows the “from” field to be forged so there is no sender listed in the email’s header.

A Gmail bug has been discovered that allows a hacker to tinker with the “from” header in an email and ultimately leave the sender display blank, rendering the email anonymous. The trick could be weaponized for phishing attacks that purport to be official warnings or system messages.

Software developer Tim Cotten, who last week discovered a similar glitch in Gmail, said in a Friday post that a vulnerability in Gmail’s UX allows the “From” field to be forged; and aptly-dubbed “ghost” emails to be subsequently sent.



To pull off the trick, Cotten said he input the recipient’s email in the “from” header (“name, recipient_email_here”) and paired it with a large and arbitrary tag, like <object>, <script> or <img>.

“This is a derivative of the previous bug… that can serve as a phishing vector,” Cotten told Threatpost. “The email sender comes out blank after you put a malformed image data in the front field.”

The result was an email lacking a sender. Even when Cotten hit “reply” on the message, no sender’s name popped up on the reply message.

Even under the “Show Original” parameter for the email message (which can be reached via the drop down tag on the sent email) he still could not see a sender’s name in the “from” field.

However, further down in the actual text he was able to see the fuzzing test case using the <img> tag.

“It was the combination of the quoted alias, a preceding word, space and the long base64, badly encoded img tag (note the misspelling),” said Cotton. “As you can see, the header itself was preserved and parsed by Google, but the UX simply can’t handle it.”

The Gmail glitch may seem harmless – but it could be easily harnessed by bad actors crafting messages purporting to be official warnings or system messages — these often come without the “from” title attached to them.


The spoofed “Ghost” email

“Without the sender information there this looks completely legitimate, and a well-educated user could easily be suckered into compromising their own account,” said Cotten.

Cotten has reported both this bug and his previously-discovered Gmail glitch to Google – the company has not responded nor has it fixed either bug. Google meanwhile did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost on the matter."

The issue comes from how Gmail automatically files messages into the “Sent” folder.

A strange glitch in Gmail can be exploited to place emails into a person’s “Sent” folder — even if that person never sent them.

Researchers who discovered the bug worry that it gives phishers and scammers another avenue to trick unsuspecting users into clicking on malicious links or opening rogue attachments.

The Gmail issue, discovered and outlined by software developer Tim Cotten this week, stems from the way that Gmail organizes its folders. It files an email into the Sent folder based on the address in the “from” field. So, if an attacker sends an email to a target, which has been specially crafted to also have that target’s email address in the “from” field, the mail will automatically go to the person’s inbox and Sent folder at the same time. This gives the false impression to the unwitting user that it was an email they themselves sent, said Cotten.

“So it appears that by structuring the from field to contain the recipient’s address along with other text, the GMail app reads the from field for filtering/inbox organization purposes and sorts the email as though it were sent from [the recipient], despite it clearly also having the originating mailbox as [another address],” he explained.

This is a potential boon for malicious actors. Spam emails to the inbox might be filtered out, but the mail that goes to the Sent folder will remain.  An attacker could then, for example, send a follow-up email asking the victim to look back at previous correspondence to find something, and from there convince them to open something malicious.

“The confusion being injected into the average user experience is an open door for malicious actors… Imagine, for instance, the scenario where a custom email could be crafted that mimics previous emails the sender has legitimately sent out containing various links,” said Cotten. “A person might, when wanting to remember what the links were, go back into their sent folder to find an example: disaster!”

Making the issue trickier, after an email is filed in the Sent folder, it looks as though it’s been read/opened, like other sent messages, except for the fact that the subject is bolded.

This is apparently not the only Gmail-filtering bug out there; Cotten also posted a note from “tekstar” discussing another trick with auto-filtering.

“For example imagine Alice emails Bob and Chad, and in the ‘to:’ field for Bob she gives Bob a different name, like ‘Brad’ [but the address is still <bob@bob.com>],” tekstar said. “If Chad replies to this email, Bob will now be in his contact list as Brad. The email is still bob@bob.com but you can see how it could be malicious, or at least fodder for fun pranks.”

Cotten has reported the findings to Google, he said."
Mobile phishing,"Innovative Phishing Tactic Makes Inroads Using Azure Blob

A brand-new approach to harvesting credentials hinges on users’ lack of cloud savvy.

A fresh tactic for phishing Office 365 users employs credential-harvesting forms hosted on Azure Blob storage – signed with legitimate Microsoft SSL certificates to lend an air of legitimacy.

Azure Blob Storage is a cloud storage solution for hosting unstructured data such as images, video or text. The storage can be accessed using both HTTP and HTTPS connections, and when using HTTPS, a signed SSL certificate from Microsoft will be displayed.

According to Netskope, a recent phishing attack saw attackers sending spam with PDF attachments, which were disguised as documents of a law firm in Denver. The file name displayed “Scan files…, please review,” and the email contained a download button with a link.

When the user clicks on the button, they’re directed to an HTML page that appears to be the Office 365 login form stored in the Microsoft Azure Blob storage solution. There’s very little to tip off the recipient that the link is malicious; the address is a valid Blob address (containing “blob.core.windows.net” in the URK), and it’s marked as a secure site thanks to the SSL certificate. Even if the user checks the certificate, he or she will see a signature issued by Microsoft IT TLS CA 5.



Once the user enters the login information, the information is whisked away to the attacker, while the page will claim to be “preparing the download” of the supposed legal documents. Eventually, it redirects the user to a Microsoft SharePoint product page.

This particular attack instance observed by Netskope was a very targeted attack, but the firm has seen an increase in gambits just like it within the last two months – at least 10 campaigns, according to Ashwin Vamshi, security researcher at Netskope.

“We expect such attacks to likely get more sophisticated and grow in popularity among threat actors because the combination of the Microsoft domain, certificate and content make this bait particularly convincing and difficult to recognize as phishing,” he told Threatpost, in an interview.

Propagation could increase as well thanks to what Netskope calls the “cloud-phishing fan-out effect.”

“In simple terms, ‘fan-out effect’ refers to a malicious artefact (file/email) being shared with a group of users via trusted means (an IT-sanctioned application or shared cloud storage folder), thus increasing the attack scope instantly,” said Vamshi. “The results in the occurrence of a secondary propagation vector when a victim inadvertently shares the phishing document (often email attachments that are saved to cloud storage services) with colleagues, whether internal or external, via a cloud service.”

When this sharing occurs, the second recipient is more likely to trust the file as though it was created by the first recipient of the attack attachment. As this propagates to additional users, the number of users potentially affected by the phishing attack can increase exponentially.

“Enterprise security teams have largely turned a blind eye to the cloud being a new threat vector,” Vamshi said. “Cloud services are built for increased collaboration and productivity, and provide capabilities like auto-sync and API-level communication; these capabilities also help attackers quickly propagate an attack within an environment. In addition, users access cloud services from any location and any device, making it difficult to not only determine attacks but also to remediate them.”

Organizations can combat this cloud phishing gambit – which Vamshi said represents an innovative new approach on the cybercrime scene – by educating users about non-standard web addresses for Azure, Google and Amazon Web Services, so they can recognize these and know they’re not an official Microsoft domain.

“Traditional security awareness trainings have not evolved to address the modern usage of cloud; most end users are savvy enough now to understand that links that include random IP addresses or suspicious sounding domain names should not be clicked on, but they don’t have a similar awareness of risk associated with cloud services,” Vamshi told us. “It is always a best practice to check the domain of the link and compare them with the domains typically used for logging in to sensitive services.”

For instance, in the attack detailed here, users in the know about cloud addresses could recognize that the phishing site (https://onedriveunbound80343[.]blob.core.windows.net/exceltyrantship68694/excel-login-1.html) is hosted in Azure Blob storage, and is therefore not an official Microsoft website.

He added that attacks such as this also highlight the need for other best practices: Enterprises to understand the shared responsibility model and identify security controls they’re responsible for; evaluate gaps in security controls created by adoption of cloud; protect against new evasion techniques leveraged by attackers; and educate security professionals as well as end users on safe usage of cloud."

Password Manager Response
Instant Apps
Share this article:


A research team suggested a new secure-by-design API after discovering design flaws in the way Android apps are verified by password managers.

A design issue in the way some popular password manager tools verify legitimate Android apps could be harnessed to help attackers launch successful phishing attacks on users.

Researchers with the University of Genoa and Eurecom inspected popular mobile password tools that sync with Android applications and concluded that the way these tools verify apps could allow an attacker to easily slip by with a spoofed app and scoop up victims’ credentials.

“The number of design issues and the variety of vulnerable heuristics that we have identified in leading password managers suggest that the insights offered in this paper are not well-understood by the community,” researchers wrote in a report released Wednesday. “The possibility of abusing Instant apps and hidden fields make these attacks even more problematic and practical.”

Researchers investigated four leading third-party mobile password manager apps – Keeper, Dashlane, LastPass, and 1Password.

Many mobile app password managers include advanced sync features which allow users to suggest website-related credentials from associated apps. These features utilize the app package name as the main abstraction to identify an app with its associated website.

However, this is where the issue lies: some apps misplace trust in an app package name (or other metadata) even if the app isn’t the actual legitimate app. As a result, it is possible for a malicious app to systematically lure password managers to leak credentials associated with arbitrary attacker-chosen websites.

An attacker could spoof an app package name for an app, and mimic a legitimate app, when syncing with a mobile password manager. The manager would then use that package name as the main way to identify the app – with no other verification – paving the way for the attacker to easily obtain passwords.

“These attacks effectively make mobile phishing more practical: differently than all previous works, the user is not even asked to type her credentials; the user is just asked to allow password managers to autofill the credentials on her behalf,” researchers said in a report.

Password Manager Response
LogMeIn, the owner of LastPass, told Threatpost that mitigations for the issue have been released as the app now requires explicit user approval before filling any unknown apps.

“This particular vulnerability in Android’s app ecosystem was brought to our attention by the University of Genoa, Italy, and EURECOM researchers through our Bug Bounty Program,” a spokesperson said. While continued efforts from the web and Android communities will also be required, we have already implemented changes to our LastPass Android app to mitigate and minimize the risk of the potential attack detailed in this report… and we’ve increased the integrity of our app associations database in order to minimize the risk of any “fake apps” being filled/accepted.”

Keeper also responded to the report on its blog, saying it has added a popup message when a user links an app to warn them that Keeper cannot validate the authenticity of the app.

“Keeper never auto-fills login and password credentials into any application without the user’s consent,” the company said in its post.

At this time, both Keeper and LogMeIn said they have no indication of any sensitive user data being compromised or phishing attacks being launched through their platforms.

A spokesperson at 1Password told Threatpost that the company is mitigating the issue by implementing Digital Asset Links “in a privacy preserving way.” Android digital asset links enable an app to make public, verifiable statements about other apps, making it more transparent about which apps are legitimate.

“What steps are we taking now? The answer is that we are moving forward with what the Simone Aonzo and his co-authors recommended: Using Digital Asset Links (DAL). We had not done so earlier because the tools for doing so were not as robust as they have now become… We don’t want someone tricking 1Password into tricking a user, and so we will not depend on unreliable and potentially malicious information from apps,” said the 1Password spokesperson.

DashLane did not respond to requests for comment from Threatpost.

Further Design Faux Pas
Another feature called Instant Apps allows users to try Android apps by just clicking on one – without fully installing the app. Developers are asked to upload small portions of their Android app and to associate a URL pattern to it.

However, an attacker can abuse the Instant Apps technology remotely because it is difficult for users utilizing this feature to distinguish between real apps and malicious ones when trying the app.

Therefore, an attacker could create a full-screen Facebook login view on an app, deceiving the victim to believing that the app is actually the social media platform and inputing their credentials into the app.

“This technology, while indeed a very useful Android feature, can make phishing attacks more practical,” researchers said. “The key observation is that Instant Apps provide an attacker the ability to gain full control over the device UI, without the need of installing an app.”

“Secure-by Design” API
Researchers stressed that the key design issue in the app syncing mechanisms is that the apps use package names as their main verification method. This puts the “daunting task” on developers to map apps to their associated domain names – and  “given the number of security issues and misplaced trust assumptions we have identified in leading password managers, we believe third-party developers should not be asked to implement this critical step.”

Instead, the research team suggested a new secure-by-design API, which would essentially directly provide a list of domain names that a given app is legitimately associated to for password managers and other tools.

“We propose a new API that implements a secure-by-design mechanism by using domain names as the only abstraction that password managers need to interact with,” they said. “Since credentials are created for websites, we argue this is a better abstraction level.”

Email Phishing,"DNC: Highly Publicized ‘Phishing Attempt’ Was Only a Security Test

DNC officials and Lookout believed a spoofed site was built to harvest authentication details for the Democratic voter database.

A day after the Democratic National Committee riled up security researchers and the press, it’s walking back an assertion that there was an attempt to compromise its voter database.

Though it seemed like the event was the latest in a series of malicious efforts designed to harvest credentials belonging political targets or influence the electorate ahead of the November midterm elections–it turns out it was only a security test.

An unnamed Democratic source told CNN Wednesday that the DNC was alerted to the presence of a spoofed log-in page designed to mimic VoteBuilder – a platform used by Democratic Party officials and campaigns across the country to manage the Democratic registered voter database. The alarm was raised by security researchers at Lookout and a cloud provider, the source said, adding that the page was a very close facsimile of the service’s legitimate access page.

DNC officials and Lookout believed the site was a malicious one, designed to trick users into filling in their authentication details, which would arm the attackers with an open door into the database. Bad actors could have lured users to spoofed sites using targeted spear-phishing emails.

However, it all turns out to be a red herring.

The DNC uses a contractor, NGP VAN, to manage VoteBuilder. Bob Lord, chief security officer at the DNC, confirmed last night that the Michigan Democratic Party asked a third party to conduct a “simulated phishing test” on the voter database. The action was carried out without authorization from the DNC — which is why the action set off alarm bells for Lookout and DNC officials.

Lord also said that the DNC is subject to “constant attempts to hack the DNC and our Democratic infrastructure,” noting that vigilance is of the utmost importance — in other words, it’s better to err on the side of caution with situations like this.

Tod Beardsley, research director at Rapid7, noted that even though this wasn’t an active hack attempt, using mirror sites is a favored method for gaining unauthorized access to all kinds of systems, including those used by high-value political targets and networks across the private sector.

“This event [still] underscores the importance of staying vigilant when using an internet browser, especially if you’re an interesting person with access to interesting data like a DNC party official who works with a proprietary voter database,” he said via email. “It’s important to remember that the presence of a green padlock isn’t the only security control in your web browser; you need to also pay close attention to the actual host name of the system you think you’re logging into.”

It’s an important point given that malicious attempts against political targets and influence campaigns are continuing. Earlier this week, Microsoft disrupted a mirror-site effort allegedly mounted by the Fancy Bear APT group; and Facebook took down hundreds of pages that were part of a network of propaganda and misinformation sites allegedly backed by the Iranian government."

microsoft outlook breach
Researchers say the “PhishPoint” tactic has already impacted 10 percent of Office 365 users globally.

UPDATE

Researchers have detected a new phishing campaign that mainly targets Office 365 customers to harvest their credentials.

The campaign, dubbed “PhishPoint,” is spread to victims via emails containing a SharePoint document and invitation to collaborate. However, when clicked, the file contains a malicious URL that snatches end users’ credentials.

“PhishPoint marks an evolution in phishing attacks, where hackers go beyond just email and use SharePoint to harvest end-users’ credentials for Office 365,” said Avanan researchers in a post about the phishing campaign, Tuesday.


Click to expand

So far, the campaign has impacted 10 percent of Avanan’s Office 365 customers – and researchers estimate that this percentage “applies to Office 365 globally.”

Michael Landewe, founder of Avanan, told Threatpost that he first saw a sharp spike in the phishing campaign about three weeks ago: “It has either started using a larger list of pre-compromised accounts, or it has hit a critical mass of compromised accounts,” he said. “Or, there is a new group using the method and not as careful as the first group.”

Avanan researchers, who first discovered the campaign, said that the victim first receives an email containing a link to a SharePoint document. Victims’ emails were most likely harvested via a previous attack or were purchased from other bad actors, Landewe said. The message purports to be a standard SharePoint invitation to collaborate.

After clicking the hyperlink in the email, the victim’s browser will automatically open a SharePoint file, the content of which impersonates a standard access request to a OneDrive file. The OneDrive file contains an “Access Document” hyperlink which, in reality, is a malicious URL.

The link within the SharePoint file directs the user to a spoofed Office 365 login screen. When the user attempts to login, their credentials are harvested by the hacker.

“This attack specifically targets Office 365 credentials,” Landewe told us. “Once the user entered their credentials, they were redirected to a legitimate Office site where they would be none the wiser. If the new credentials were used, the attackers would upload a file into that person’s SharePoint account and send an invite from SharePoint (rather than from the user’s account).”


Click to expand

Office 365 does scan links in email bodies to look for blacklisted or suspicious domains – however, because the link in the email leads to an actual SharePoint document, Microsoft did not identify it as a threat.

“The crux of this attack is that Microsoft link-scanning only goes one level deep, scanning the links in the email body, but not within files hosted on their other services, such as SharePoint,” researchers said in their post.

In order to identify this threat, Microsoft would have to scan links within shared documents for phishing URLs, researchers added: “This presents a clear vulnerability that hackers have taken advantage of to propagate phishing attacks.”

Even if Microsoft did scan links within files, there’s an additional challenge: The URL couldn’t be blacklisted without blacklisting links to all SharePoint files. “If they blacklisted the full URL of the Sharepoint file, the hackers could easily create a new URL by uploading a new file with similar content to SharePoint,” researchers explained.

A Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost that: “Contrary to Avanan’s marketing claims, there are multiple layered defenses in Office 365 that detect this type of attack. We encourage users to check the authenticity of the links prior to clicking them, avoid opening links in emails from senders they don’t recognize, or visiting unsecure sites.”​

Researchers believe that specific companies are being targeted. “We have seen it in [Fortune] 500 companies in the U.S., as well as small, under-100-person companies in Europe,” said Landewe.

Phishing attacks continue to increase and adopt new tactics – and spam is increasing accordingly. A recent report this week by Kaspersky Lab found that spam email, in particular, remains a top phishing tactic. In the second quarter of 2018, the amount of spam peaked in May up to 51 percent; while the average share of spam in email traffic worldwide was 50 percent.

To protect themselves, researchers said there are basic good practices that companies can take, including being aware of any email subject line that capitalizes buzzwords for workplace stress (like “Urgent” or “Action Required”), and staying suspicious of any URLs that show up in the body of emails."

He said mobile is redefining traditional inbox phishing. On smartphones, phishing includes dangerous links inside text messages and fake Facebook accounts that drive traffic to malicious websites or invite victims to download trojan apps.

Murray also specifically focuses in on APT attack techniques used by Dark Caracal and Stealth Mango.

“The cellphone is such a powerful espionage device… Nobody ever turns it off. They lay it on their bedside table at night. They walk into every meeting with it.

Email Phishing,"New Actor DarkHydrus Targets Middle East with Open-Source Phishing

DarkHydrus uses the open-source Phishery tool to create two of the known Word documents used in the attacks.

Government entities and educational institutions in the Middle East are under attack in an ongoing credential-harvesting campaign, mounted by a newly-named threat group known as DarkHydrus. In a twist on the norm, the group is leveraging the open-source Phishery tool to carry out its dark work.

The attacks follow a well-worn pattern, according to Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 group: Spear-phishing emails with attached malicious Microsoft Office documents are leveraging the “attachedTemplate” technique to load a template from a remote server.

“When attempting to load this remote template, Microsoft Office will display an authentication dialog box to ask the user to provide log-in credentials,” the researchers explained in a posting this week. “When entered, these credentials are then sent to the C2 server, which allows DarkHydrus to collect the user account credentials.”

So far, that’s not a new approach — US-CERT warned of the same technique by a different threat group in 2017. What’s different about this effort is DarkHydrus’ use of the open-source Phishery tool to create two of the known Word documents used in the attacks – and the fact that the group seems to be highly active even though it has only recently been uncovered.

Test-Driving Phishery

The Phishery tool is capable of creating malicious Word documents by injecting a remote template URL; it also hosts a C2 server to gather the credentials entered into the authentication dialog boxes. In other words, it’s a turn-key solution for these kinds of attacks – and, thanks to this campaign, has been shown to be effective in real-world offensives.

Unite 42 researchers tried the tool out themselves to verify that it’s enabling the campaign.

“We were able to replicate the remote template path using Phishery to create a weaponized delivery document,” Unit 42 researchers noted. “To confirm, we used Phishery’s C2 server and opened DarkHydrus’ Word document from the June 2018 attacks. When presented with the authentication dialog box, we entered ‘fakename’ and ‘fakepass’ as credentials and pressed enter.”

On the C2 server, they observed Phishery receiving the inbound request and capturing the credentials.

Also, Unit 42 last week uncovered a different spear-phishing attack on Middle Eastern government entities, this time used to deliver a PowerShell payload that the firm dubbed RogueRobin. The campaign uses Excel Web Query files – a novel method that Threatpost has previously detailed. Unit 42 attributed this effort to DarkHydrus as well, based on domain infrastructure analysis. It turns out that RogueRobin – a custom script that backdoors targeted machines – appears to be cobbled together from open-source code snippets – for instance, it uses the open-source Invoke-Obfuscation tool to obfuscate the PowerShell script.

Thus, there appears to be a pattern: “The use of Phishery further shows Dark Hydrus’ reliance on open-source tools to conduct their operations,” researchers noted.

Tricky Attacks

Starting June 24, Unit 42 began seeing suspicious emails arriving in targets’ in-boxes, with the subject line of “Project Offer.”

When users click open the attachments, they’re confronted by an empty document obscured by a dialog box asking for credentials. After users fill in the authentication details, the Word document remains—but it’s still empty.

“While this document was empty, the authentication prompt may have made the targeted user more likely to enter their credentials, thinking it’s necessary to view the contents of the document,” Unit 42 researchers said.



In another attempt at looking legit, the subdomain name cited in the dialog box is a domain of the targeted entity, and it makes use of known Outlook behavior.

“Also, the 0utl00k[.]net domain resembles Microsoft’s legitimate ‘outlook.com’ domain that provides free email services, which also make the user less suspicious and more likely to enter their credentials,” Unite 42 researchers explained. “Some users may not even notice what domain the dialog states they are connecting to and habitually type their Windows credentials.”

Interestingly, related Word documents were also observed being used in phishing campaigns back in September and November 2017. Unlike the empty June 2018 document, both of these displayed pertinent information to the targeted organization, such as an employee survey. The infrastructure used in those credential-harvesting attacks resolved to the same IP address used by DarkHydrus in the attacks that started in June, further linking the activity together as being carried out by the same threat actor.

All of this “suggests that DarkHydrus has been carrying out this credential harvesting campaign for almost a year,” the analysts noted.

DarkHydrus itself, while newly named, has been around in an organized and focused form for even longer, they added.

“Based on our telemetry, we were able to uncover additional artifacts leading us to believe this adversary group has been in operation with their current playbook since early 2016,” Unit 42 researchers noted."

Phishing emails purported to be commercial offers – but were really installing remote administration software on victims’ systems.

Industrial production companies are the targets in a large-scale spear-phishing email campaign aimed at installing legitimate remote administration software on victims’ systems.

Researchers with Kaspersky Lab said that emails purporting to be commercial offers were the conduit to enabling attackers to gain remote control of the systems for financial gain.

“According to the data available, the attackers’ main goal is to steal money from victim organizations’ accounts,” the researchers said in a post on Wednesday. “When attackers connect to a victim’s computer, they search for and analyze purchase documents, as well as the financial and accounting software used. After that, the attackers look for various ways in which they can commit financial fraud, such as spoofing the bank details used to make payments.”

Researchers observed a spate of these types of emails starting in November 2017 — and the campaign is ongoing, having targeted up to 400 industrial companies located in Russia. The phishing emails are well-designed, with some purporting to be invitations to tender from large industrial companies, researchers said.

Attackers have paid careful attention to detail in the content of each email, accurately reflecting the activity of the targeted organization and the type of work performed by the employee to whom the email is sent. This suggests a high level of reconnaissance work.

“It is worth noting that the attackers addressed an employee of the company under attack by his or her full name,” researchers said. “This indicates that the attack was carefully prepared and an individual email that included details relevant to the specific organization was created for each victim.”

Some of these emails contain malicious attachments, packed into their archives; others have no attachments, but with message text designed to lure users into links that lead to external resources, and then downloading malicious objects from those resources.

“There are several known ways in which the malware can be installed in a system,” researchers said. “Malicious files can be run either by an executable file attached to an email or by a specially crafted script for the Windows command interpreter.”

RMS vs TeamViewer
Regardless of the installation method, all emails kicked off malicious processes that install one of two types of legitimate remote administration software – either TeamViewer or Remote Manipulator System/Remote Utilities (RMS).

For both, malicious code is injected into the process by substituting a malicious library for system DLL.

The malicious library includes the system file winspool.drv, which is located in the system folder and is used to send documents to the printer. Once loaded, winspool.drv decrypts configuration files prepared by the attackers, including software settings and the password for remotely controlling the machine.

In the case of RMS, one of the configuration files contains an email address to which information about the infected system is sent (including computer name, user name and the RMS machine’s internet ID).

TeamViewer software is different in that information from infected systems is sent to malware command-and-control servers rather that via email. It has a file in its malicious library containing various parameters, such as the password used for remotely controlling the system and a URL of the attackers’ command-and-control server. Unlike RMS, Team Viewer also uses a built-in VPN to remotely control a computer located behind NAT.

After infecting victims’ computers, attackers use either tool to take control and search for purchase documents, or financial and accounting software. After that, there are various ways they can commit financial fraud, including spoofing the bank details used to make payments.

Concerning Trends
Researchers said that industrial companies are more enticing as a target for cybercriminals due to widespread security weaknesses in their operational technology systems.

“This choice on the part of the cybercriminals could be explained by the fact that the threat-awareness and cybersecurity culture in industrial companies is inferior to that in companies from other sectors of the economy (such as banks or IT companies),” they said.

Also concerning is the use of legitimate remote administration software to evade detection by antivirus solutions, a trend that researchers said will continue: “Remote administration capabilities give criminals full control of compromised systems, so possible attack scenarios are not limited to the theft of money. In the process of attacking their targets, the attackers steal sensitive data belonging to target organizations, their partners and customers, carry out surreptitious video surveillance of the victim companies’ employees, and record audio and video using devices connected to infected machines.”"

DanaBot, a Novel Banking Trojan
Share this article:


A new phishing scam purports to be MYOB invoices – but really contains a novel banking trojan.

The recently-discovered DanaBot banking trojan is making the rounds in a phishing campaign that targets potential victims with fake invoices from software company MYOB.

The emails purport to be invoices from MYOB, an Australian multinational corporation that provides tax, accounting and other business services software for SMBs. But in reality, the missives contain a dropper file that downloads the DanaBot banking trojan, which once downloaded steals private and sensitive information, and sends screenshots of the machine’s system and desktop to the Command and Control server.

“Cybercriminals are targeting victims in Australian companies and infecting them with sophisticated multi-stage, multi-component and stealthy banking trojans like DanaBot to steal their private and sensitive information,” said Trustwave researchers in a post about the campaign, Friday. “In this campaign the attackers sent targeted phishing emails in the form of fake MYOB invoice messages with invoice links pointing to compromised FTP servers hosting the DanaBot malware.”

According to Trustwave researchers Fahim Abbasi and Diana Lopera, a flurry of phishing email scams have been spotted targeting Australian customers of MYOB. The phishing emails used the standard MYOB-like html invoice template to convince users they are real; telling the client that an invoice is due and asking them to “View Invoice” via a button at the bottom of the email.

Karl Sigler, threat intelligence manager SpiderLabs at Trustwave, told Threatpost that criminals likely purchased or perhaps generated their own list of likely MYOB customers. “Given how much information people share publicly, especially on social networks, these lists are not hard to come by,” he said. Trustwave didn’t have any information about how many victims specifically were targeted by the campaign.



Interestingly, instead of using the more common HTTP application layer protocol for links, the emails leveraged the file transfer protocol (FTP) pointing to compromised FTP servers (mostly using Australian domains).

“In clicking this ‘View Invoice’ button a zip archive is pulled down from what we believe is a compromised FTP server of an Australian company,” researchers said. “FTP credentials are supplied in the FTP link that is embedded in the ‘View Invoice’ button.”

Sigler told Threatpost that the use of FTP is an “odd choice” and not something researchers usually see. “It seems likely that the criminals compromised the FTP server of an Australian company and are using it to spread the malware,” he said. “It’s probably just a matter of convenience and using what was available to them at the time.”

From the FTP server a .Zip archive is downloaded. Contained inside the .Zip archive is a JavaScript downloader that when executed downloads the DanaBot trojan.

DanaBot, a Novel Banking Trojan
DanaBot is a banking trojan discovered in May targeting users in Australia via emails containing malicious URLs. The trojan, first discovered by Proofpoint researchers, has been one of the biggest cybercrime developments of 2018, so far.

“DanaBot is the latest example of malware focused on persistence and stealing useful information that can later be monetized rather than demanding an immediate ransom from victims,” Proofpoint researchers said at the time about the trojan. “DanaBot’s modular nature enables it to download additional components, increasing the flexibility and robust stealing and remote monitoring capabilities of this banker.”

In this most recent campaign, the DanaBot malware first drops a downloader file onto the disk and executes it. The downloader then downloads a Master DLL (a dynamic link library, which contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time).

Once downloaded, the DanaBot master DLL then downloads and decrypts an encrypted file which contains a variety of modules and configuration files. The DLL modules include a VNC, a stealer, a sniffer and TOR: “The filenames of the DLLs extracted from the encrypted file reveal the true intention of the attackers,” researchers said. “In essence, these DLLs enable the attacker to create and control a remote host via VNC, steal private and sensitive information and use covert channels via Tor.”

Meanwhile, the five configuration files (PInject, BitKey, BitVideo, BitFilesX and Zfilter) will set about with their own functions. “These files are used by the malware as a reference for what to look for on the victims machine,” Sigler told Threatpost.

That includes PInject, which contains the web injection configuration file where the targets are Australian banks. BitKey and BitVideo are two other config files that contain the list of cryptocurrency processes that the bot will monitor. BitFilesX contains a list of the cryptocurrency files the bot will monitor. Finally, Zfilter searches for processes that that the malware should monitor for network sniffing.

Researchers also noted that the DanaBot malware seems to be hosted on a domain that has been configured with “round robin DNS” which uses multiple IPs  to rotate the traffic and point them to the attacker controlled infrastructure.

“The infrastructure supporting the malware is designed to be flexible while the malware is designed to be modular with functionality spread across multiple components that are heavily encrypted,” the researchers warned."
Smishing,"New Phishing Scam Reels in Netflix Users to TLS-Certified Sites

Researchers are warning of a new Netflix phishing scam that leads to sites with valid TLS certificates.

Researchers are warning of a new Netflix phishing scam that leads victims to sites with valid Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.

Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Technology Institute, said Wednesday that there’s been an uptick in Netflix phishing mails using TLS-certified sites.

The bad actors behind the attacks will take advantage of unpatched installs or plugins, or weak passwords, to compromise usual-suspect CMS software, like WordPress or Drupal, said Ullrich. From there, they can create phishing sites that could be mistaken for real Netflix domains. In some cases, they’re using wildcard DNS records.

“With a wildcard DNS record, *anything.domain.com will point to the same IP address,” the researcher said in a post. “The attacker will just use a subdomain/hostname to launch the attack. But I have also seen them use specific domain names registered for the phish.”

The attacker can then obtain a TLS certificate for a host name that is Netflix-related, such as netflix.domain.com or netflix.login.domain.com; this helps the site evade being flagged by safe-browser software.

The initial spoofed emails are the weak part of the campaign, and are easy to spot, said Ullrich.

“The email was marked as spam, and the email is not worded that well,” he said. “In this case, the link went to hxxps://www.safenetflax.com, a domain registered just to impersonate Netflix. This domain no longer resolves.”



After clicking on the link, Ullrich found that the websites appear believable and look very much like the real Netflix: “The only modification I can spot is that the alternative login methods like Facebook are missing,” he said.

While Netflix accounts aren’t particularly valuable (Ullrich said he has seen them offered from $0.20-0.50 per account), the attack may be enticing to cyber-criminals as it can be easily automated – and hard for victims to spot, he said.

“Once a Netflix account is compromised, it can often be used for a long time undetected as Netflix allows multiple simultaneous streams for its standard and premium accounts,” said Ullrich. “Unless the legitimate user gets ‘kicked off’ for using too many streams, the legitimate user will never know that there is someone else using their account.”



The method of using TLS for phishing attacks has increased dramatically over the years;  last year,  Zscaler said that it saw a 400 percent increase of phishing attempts delivered with SSL/TLS over 2016.

“Hackers are posting phishing pages on legitimate domains that they have compromised” said Deepen Desai, director of security research at Zscaler in a post about the increase. “Many of these legitimate sites support SSL/TLS, and there are very few network security solutions that can support inspection of encrypted packets at scale.”

However, Ullrich said ultimately the bad actor could have made a mistake using TLS; because it is easy for Netflix or others to find the sites easily via certificate transparency logs; and, “I doubt many users would notice if the site didn’t use TLS,” he said.

Netflix phishing campaigns have been ongoing for years, but recently a new array of fake email and malicious links seem to have cropped up, with various law enforcement warning citizens to be on the lookout for the scams.

A spate of police forces in Canada for instance have recently advised the public of a phishing scam that involves bad actors impersonating Netflix to obtain victims’ banking information.

Netflix, for its part, recommends users avoid clicking links sent via email; and that they report any suspicious messages through its official website."
Mobile phishing,"World Cup, Vacation Scams Lead in Phishing Trips this Summer

Scammers recently targeted Booking.com customers via WhatsApp messages and texts asking them for full payment for holidays.

Summer is one of the traditional seasons of scamming, and this summer is shaping up to be a hot one on that front, with active campaigns swirling around supposed “security incidents,” vacation bookings and, of course, the World Cup.

Scammers, for instance, recently targeted Booking.com customers via WhatsApp messages and texts asking them to change their passwords in the wake of a supposed security breach. These were, of course, all phishing lures designed to steal their sensitive financial information.

Booking.com told the Sun newspaper in the UK that the attack correspondence was fully outfitted with booking information. The attackers, it said, likely compromised the systems of hotels to find out details like customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, dates and prices of bookings and reference numbers.

The malefactors then followed up with a second message demanding full payment for holidays and asking for bank information to process it.

Sinan Eren, CEO at Fyde Security, told us that there are fresh trends in phishing trips this season, including a move away from email to new communication mediums.

“An interesting development in this new Booking.com campaign is that attackers shifted to text and instant messaging due to lack of robust security and spam filters on those systems,” Eren told Threatpost. “Mobile carriers’ SMS gateways are legacy systems that do not have any modern detection and remediation capabilities. It is rather easy and cheap to open a Twilio or Nexmo account with a stolen credit card and send out text messages to millions of smartphones in a short amount of time. These messaging API providers only react retroactively and shut down accounts once the fraudulent nature of the campaign is reported at volume.”

Further, he noted that instant messaging protocols such as WhatsApp are peer-to-peer by design, so they can only offer very rudimentary controls for detecting scams.

Another phishing lure making the rounds is an Alaska Airlines scam that uses a post on Facebook. It purports to be from Alaska Airlines, offering two free tickets in exchange for completing a short three-question survey; once that’s done, it asks the person to share the page to their Facebook to finalize the deal.

“You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Alaska Airlines Tickets! We only have 121 Tickets remaining so hurry up” the scam proclaims. It obviously works, considering that it’s been making the rounds in some form since at least 2016.

“If you are sent to a website that is not alaskaair.com, promoted from alaskaair.com and/or does not have any affiliation or links to Alaska’s official websites, then it could be a fake promotion,” the airline cautioned.

The Facebook angle is also indicative of more widespread phishing trends: the bad guys are looking to leverage the network effect and chain of trust to gain a better ROI on campaigns by asking users to share the post.

“We have been seeing an increasing amount of social engineering schemes to further propagate the scam,” Eren said. “For example, in order to be eligible for the prize, you are required to share the message with 25 of your contacts, etc. It’s rather obvious that attackers using the network effect instead of propagating the scam from a single point, which is easier to take down, plus a lot less trusted by the recipient.”

A kind of positive trolling is another new tactic, he added, where fraudsters add fake social media followers and comments to their sites and posts to increase conversion, as seen below:


Fake comments promoting a Disneyland Paris scam.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup is about to kick off in Russia, with the soccer tournament once again taking its place as a perennial favorite for scammery. The hat-trick of nefariousness involves dubious messages promoting free tickets to the tournament (and who wouldn’t want an all-expenses paid trip to a match?); emails containing news and highlight reels about World Cup teams and players like Argentinian national star and Barcelona hero Lionel Messi, along with malicious attachments and links; and scams claiming to offer free live streams of the action in return for filling out a survey or installing software.

“The World Cup is THE global sporting event, which brings a fantastic opportunity for cybercriminals intent on securing a quick payday,” Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum, said via email. “Email infection, fake betting websites and traditional phishing attacks are all expected to have their day in the sun this summer. Have fun watching the games, and rooting for your country, but let’s make sure that we all end up on the winning side and don’t end up becoming just another statistic on the losing side.”

Prizes around World Cup tickets and travel will also drive an increase in digital ad-driven phishing campaigns, Eren said, adding, “Most ad networks still do not sufficiently police programmatic buys of digital ads.”

According to Kaspersky Lab, statistics show spikes in the number of phishing pages during match ticket sales.

“Every time tickets went on sale, fraudsters mailed out spam and activated clones of official FIFA pages and sites offering fake giveaways allegedly from partner companies. But as the event draws nearer, cyber-scams are reaching fever pitch,” the firm said in a recent post.

Protect Yourself

Don Lewis of EdgeWave provided the following consumer tips to Threatpost:

Never respond to emails from booking sites you’ve not dealt with or heard of before. Don’t click on the emails, but open a new browser search in new window and verify the legitimacy of the site, as well as check their online reviews in other places. If the offer seems too good to be true, it probably is… verify the offer via other means if needed.
If you believe you’re receiving an email from a booking site that you have worked with before but the email is asking you to complete an action that appears odd, based on timing or what they are asking, take time to validate the request via other methods. For example, if you get an email asking to update your profile or provide credit-card information, do not give it. If they already have a profile built with your personal information and credit-card information, it would be highly unlikely they would email you asking for this information again. Take the time to verify with them separately before completing any online forms simply because they asked for it. This also applies to other scams where you’re notified that your reservation has been changed or cancelled. Instead of clicking on an email with this information, go to the website directly and login to see if your reservations are intact. If you’re unsure, email their support team or call them directly to verify.
If you’re going to make a new booking and you have already vetted the online site, before submitting any information, make sure the web session is secure (i.e. that it’s a secured form in HTTPS): ensure that a green padlock is visible in the top left-hand corner of the navigation bar when you’re prompted to enter financial details.
Don’t set your account passwords for travel sites to be the same as your email or banking sites.  Always keep these passwords separate and change them every few months, or sooner if you think you could have been compromised.
Finally, report suspicious emails and phishing sites to US-CERT at this link. The more people are educated and aware of the latest scams, the more they can take action quicker to be protected, thus minimizing the damage that the hacker can do."
Mobile phishing,"Roaming Mantis Swarms Globally, Spawning iOS Phishing, Cryptomining

Analysis shows that the malware, previously a banking trojan focused on Android devices, has rapidly evolved just in the past month.

The Roaming Mantis mobile banking trojan is roaming further afield than it ever has before. Recent analysis shows that the malware has rapidly evolved just in the past month. It’s now targeting Europe and the Middle East in addition to Asian countries. According to researchers, it’s following the cyber-zeitgeist by expanding its capabilities to include cryptomining (and iOS phishing).

Roaming Mantis is a mostly-mobile malware which this year has been spreading via DNS hijacking. Potential victims are typically redirected to a malicious webpage that distributes a trojanized application that pretends to be either Facebook or Chrome. Once installed manually by users, a trojan banker will execute.

Its sights have become much wider, however.

“Roaming Mantis has evolved quickly,” said Kaspersky Lab researcher Suguru Ishimaru, in an analysis posted on Friday. “The actors behind it have been quite active in improving their tools. The rapid growth of the campaign implies that those behind it have a strong financial motivation and are probably well-funded.”

Global Infections

On the multilingual front, Roaming Mantis (a.k.a. MoqHao or XLoader) was seen this month to have significantly tweaked its landing pages and malicious APK files to support 27 languages – a serious expansion from the four languages it used in campaigns just a month ago.

In campaigns observed in April, its activity was located mostly in Bangladesh, Japan and South Korea, according to Ishimaru. Kaspersky Lab has now confirmed that several more languages have been hardcoded in the HTML source of the landing page.

These include; Arabic, Armenian, Bulgarian, Bengali, both traditional and simplified Chinese, Czech, English, Georgian, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.

The expansion is succeeding in terms of garnering more victims: “We believe the attacker made use of an easy method to potentially infect more users, by translating their initial set of languages with an automatic translator,” Ishimaru said. “It’s clear from [our data] that South Korea, Bangladesh and Japan are no longer the worst affected countries; instead, Russia, Ukraine and India [bear] the brunt.”

New Targets and Tactics

In addition to broadening its target range, an analysis of the Roaming Mantis code reveals the criminals behind the malware have added a phishing option that targets iOS device users and a cryptomining option targeting PCs. This is a departure from the group’s primary focus on the Android platform, researchers said.

“When a user connects to the landing page via iOS devices, the user is redirected to ‘http://security.apple[dot]com/’,” Ishimaru explained. “A legitimate DNS server wouldn’t be able to resolve a domain name like that, because it simply doesn’t exist. However, a user connecting via a compromised router can access the landing page because the rogue DNS service resolves this domain to the IP address 172[.]247[.]116[.]155. The final page is a phishing page mimicking the Apple website with the very reassuring domain name ‘security.apple[dot]com’ in the address bar of the browser.”

The phishing site steals user IDs, passwords, card numbers, card expiration dates and CVVs. Here is where researchers said the HTML source of the phishing site supported 25 languages. Notably,  the languages Bengali and Georgian are missing from the phishing site.

Meanwhile, the perpetrators have added a new feature such as web mining via a the CoinHive script executed in the browser. “When a user connects to the landing page from a PC, the CPU usage will drastically increase because of the cryptomining activity in the browser,” Ishimaru said.

Better Evasion Techniques

“The evasion techniques used by Roaming Mantis have also become more sophisticated. Several examples of recent additions described in [the Kaspersky Lab post] include a new method of retrieving the C2 by using the email POP protocol, server-side dynamic auto-generation of changing APK file names, and the inclusion of an additional command to potentially assist in identifying research environments,” researchers wrote.

The dynamic auto-generation helps avoid blacklisting, they said.

“Aside from the filename, we also observed that all the downloaded malicious APK files are unique due to package generation in real time as of May 16, 2018,” explained Ishimaru. “It seems the actor added automatic generation of APK per download to avoid blacklisting by file hashes. This is a new feature.”

Meanwhile, older Roaming Mantis samples connected to the C2 by accessing a “legitimate website, extracting a Chinese string from a specific part of the HTML code, and decoding it,” said the researcher. In the most recent sample, instead of using HTML protocol, Roaming Mantis uses email protocol to retrieve the C2.

“The malware connects to an email inbox using hardcoded outlook.com credentials via POP3,” Ishimaru said. “It then obtains the email subject (in Chinese) and extracts the real C2 address using the string ‘abcd’ as an anchor.”

Also, the previous malicious APK from April “had 18 backdoor commands to confirm victims’ environments and to control devices.” It’s now added a feature that calls the OS ping command with the IP address of the C2 server.

“By running this, the attackers validate the availability of the server, packet travel time or detect network filtering in the target network,” he said. “This feature can also be used to detect semi-isolated research environments.”

In August 2017, McAfee first identified and reported the existence of Roaming Mantis. At that time, the distribution method was SMS and South Korea was its only target. “[By] April 2018, it had already implemented DNS hijacking and expanded its targets to the wider Asian region,” Ishimaru said.

This latest expansion indicates that the actors behind the malware have no intention of slowing down their attack rate."
Email Phishing,"Phishing Spy Campaign Targets Top Mideast Officials

Researchers have discovered a set of custom surveillanceware tools being deployed against Android and iOS devices primarily in the Middle East.

Researchers have discovered a phishing campaign that infected Android devices with custom surveillance-ware bent on extracting data from top officials, primarily in the Middle East.

Researchers at Lookout Security told Threatpost that the tool, dubbed Stealth Mango, has been used to collect over 30 gigabytes of compromised data on attacker infrastructure, including call records, audio recordings, device location information and text messages.

“These tools have been part of a highly targeted intelligence gathering campaign we believe is operated by members of the Pakistani military,” Lookout researchers said in a report. “Our investigation indicates this actor has used these surveillance-ware tools to successfully compromise the mobile devices of government officials, members of the military, medical professionals and civilians.”

Once a device is infected with Stealth Mango, the malware initially uploads all data from an infected device and then tracks all changes that occur as soon as they happen. This includes installed device information, changes in SIM cards on the device, pictures and audio stored on the device and contact lists.

Stealth Mango has been evolving over the months; in February 2018, for instance, the tool also showed functionality like key-logging, screenshot captures and screen-record functionality; the ability to track victims in real time; and the ability to access the message databases of third-party social media applications.

Lookout told Threatpost that a “ballpark figure” of around 100 unique devices were impacted by the targeted surveillance operations, including those of government officials, members of the military, and activists in Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. Data of officials from other countries, like the U.S. and Germany, have also been swept up in the campaign.

Lookout said it believes the threat actor behind Stealth Mango is also behind the Operation Transparent Tribe and Operation C-Major campaigns, which targeted Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan, as well as the Indian military.

 

Attack Vector

Lookout researchers believe that attackers infected devices with Stealth Mango using both phishing techniques as well as at least one watering hole used to distribute the malware.

The watering hole URL was first sent to targets, often via Facebook Messenger. This suggests the “the attackers are using fake personas to connect with their targets and coerce them into installing the malware onto their devices,” researchers said.

Once they clicked on the URL, victims were taken to the watering hole, which purports to be the third-party Android App store known as APKMonk (secure-apps.azurewebsites[.]net). However, when victims clicked on any link on the site, they would re-direct to the Stealth Mango APK.

Lookout said they initiated a takedown with Microsoft of this particular watering hole, and the account was ultimately suspended.

Researchers also found that these threat actors are using multi-platform capabilities with several custom tools; and while most of the research focused on the Stealth Mango Android component, there is also evidence of an iOS tool believed to be a variant of Tangelo, being developed as well.

Researchers said that that the two tools appear to have been created by the same developer group, but it’s unclear if the iOS component is still in a trial phase, or if it is being used in active campaigns as well.

“There’s likely an iOS piece being used alongside Stealth Mango and communicating to the same infrastructure, but we haven’t found that piece in the wild at this time… and we’re not sure how it’s being deployed,” said Michael Flossman, head of threat intelligence at Lookout, in an interview. “However, given the existence of Tangelo on a different server we’re pretty sure the variation of that is being used by these guys.”

 

Threat Actor

Lookout linked the tools to freelance software developers with ties to the Pakistani military, with physical presences in Pakistan, India and the United States.

“Further analysis of server-side logs on attacker infrastructure showed three IPs that geolocate to a specific area of the G-8 area in Islamabad, Pakistan,” Lookout’s report detailed.

“This is another nation-state based actor that is using commodity tooling without resorting to any sort of zero-day or exploit, and getting a lot of value from that model,” added Andrew Blaich, head of device intelligence at Lookout, told Threatpost. “It shows there’s a lot of variants in terms of the surveillance-ware out there and you can get a lot of stuff done without utilizing exploits.”

There were a couple of surprises in the threat actor’s approach as well.

When looking at the threat actor’s infrastructure, which used two IP addresses, “we were surprised to find how wide open the server was,” Flossman told Threatpost. “This actor focused very much on setting up the remote infrastructure without securing it…As a result, exfiltrated data was publicly accessible.”

In another surprise to researchers, Flossman added that they found the infrastructure running the WSO web shell, which provides a third party with complete control over the server.

Researchers said it’s unclear when the campaign was first deployed, but they first came across it in mid-January 2018. The latest release of Stealth Mango was as recently as April 2018.

“At the moment, the infrastructure behind these operations appears to be down,  but we don’t expect them to disappear… we expect them to surface again with other mobile components,” said Flossman."
Spear phishing,"GDPR Phishing Scam Targets Apple Accounts, Financial Data

A phishing scam fooled victims by claiming to be Apple and scooping up personal details – including financial information and Apple account information.

A phishing campaign targeting Apple users is attempting to trick victims into updating their profiles under the guise it’s a part of proactive security hardening prepping for the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policies set to go into effect on May 25. The phishing campaign’s objective is to con victims into disclosing Apple account credentials in order to scoop up personal details – including credit card and Apple account information.

This scam is one of many taking advantage of the impending introduction of EU GDPR policies.

“On April 30, we detected a new Apple ID phishing scam using a known social engineering tactic —threatening to suspend a service to pressure users into divulging personal details,” wrote Trend Micro researchers in a blog post about the scam last week. “Multisite login details, like an Apple ID and corresponding password, are valuable because they can give an attacker access to all the applications linked to that account.”

The phishing email purports to be a legitimate email from Apple. The email notifies victims that their Apple account has been “limited” due to unusual activity and urges them to update their payment details via a link.

The link opens to a fake Apple website that looked like the legitimate website in most respects – even containing the same background image as the real Apple site – but with a different URL.

Researchers said that the malicious website was offline at the time of its report.

From there, users were prompted enter their Apple IDs and passwords. When users put in their information, the website offers a standard message telling them their account has been locked, and offering a button to unlock it.

The “Unlock Account Now” button is linked to a malicious site that collects user data. This site asks for a slew of personal information like name, date of birth, address, and credit card details.

In addition to looking legitimate, this website appeared to be more sophisticated than most phishing sites due in part to the web directory permissions being set correctly, researchers noted: “Malicious actors usually use free hosting sites for their phishing scams since they expect them to have short lifespans, and they don’t put any effort into securing web server files,” they said in the post. “Because of this, it is typically easy to obtain information from phishing attacks and related sites; sometimes even the stolen data is accessible. In this case, the web directory permissions were set correctly, so we were not able to access that information.”

After all personal and account information fields were filled in, the site informed victims they would be logged out for security reasons and forwarded the user to the legitimate Apple website.

Strengths – And Mistakes

Like many phishing emails, the initial emails sent to users had big red flags – including, most notably, the fact that the emails were sent to some victims who were not using Apple products.

“It was sent to a person who was not using Apple products, and if there was suspicious activity why would a customer need to update payment details? Upon checking, we also saw that the button linked to a site that is not related to the Apple domain name,” said researchers.

However, beyond that the campaign did show worrisome sophisticated measures – including the tricks listed above surrounding the legitimate-looking Apple spoof website. And beyond that, the bad actors used other sophisticated methods – including encrypting the spoof site using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) – allowing it to bypass some anti-phishing tools embedded in antivirus solutions.

“Using AES for this kind of obfuscation is unusual for a phishing scam because… usually these malicious actors are more concerned with operations rather than security or evasion,” said the researchers."

The Department of Justice has announced charges against nine Iranians, affiliated with the Mabna Institute, who are accused of stealing private data from U.S. universities, private companies, and U.S. government departments.

The United States Department of Justice announced charges against nine Iranians accused of stealing private data from U.S. universities, private companies and U.S. government agencies.

FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said in a statement that the state-sponsored hackers worked for more than four years to steal expensive science and engineering-related research, company trade secrets, and sensitive U.S. government information.

The stolen information was used by the Iranian government or sold for profit, said the FBI. According to the indictment, the hackers stole more than 30 terabytes of academic data– IP that totaled $3.4 billion for the U.S. universities to procure.

The nine hackers, who are currently at large, are affiliated with the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company created in 2013. The FBI said that this company was created for the “express purpose of illegally gaining access to non-Iranian scientific resources through computer intrusions.”

“Members of the institute were contracted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—one of several entities within the Iranian government responsible for gathering intelligence—as well as other Iranian government clients,” according to the U.S. indictment. “The exfiltrated data… were obtained for the benefit of the IRGC, and were also sold within Iran, including through two websites.”

The hackers allegedly targeted five U.S. government entities, including the Department of Labor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions.

They are also accused of targeting 144 U.S.-based universities and 176 foreign universities in 21 countries; as well as 50 private companies, the majority of which were U.S. firms.

Spear Phishing and Intrusion Tactics

The FBI said that the hackers initially used an elaborate spear phishing campaign to successfully target the e-mail accounts and computer systems of more than 8,000 professor accounts.

“Their primary goal was to obtain user names and passwords for the accounts of professors so they could gain unauthorized access and steal whatever kind of proprietary academic information they could get their hands on,” said the FBI’s statement.

Hackers would first research professors’ interests and the academic articles they had published, and then sent spear phishing emails to those targets.

The emails, which appeared to be from professors at other universities, tricked many of the victims to click on links that recorded their keystrokes when they signed into what they thought were their secure university domains. In actuality these linked domains were bogus sites controlled by the hackers.

In addition to spearphishing, hackers also began targeting various U.S. federal agencies using a method where they collected lists of names and e-mail accounts through open-source internet searches. The hackers then guessed users’ passwords, hoping that some users never changed default company passwords or used common ones such as “password123,” the FBI said.

Bowdich  said that the victims have been notified so that they could take action to minimize the impact.

Mark Orlando, chief technology officer for cyber services at Raytheon, said it was shocking how simple it was for attackers to use these methods to compromise systems.

“For the universities, all they had to do was email professors, say how much they liked their work, and trick them into clicking over to a fake login page,” he said. “For the other targets, they simply collected e-mail addresses and guessed the passwords.”

The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on Monday joined the U.S. in condemning the alleged attacks, particularly relating to universities based in the UK.


“The UK Government judges that the Mabna Institute based in Iran was responsible for a hacking campaign targeting universities around the world. By stealing intellectual property from universities, these hackers attempted to make money and gain technological advantage at our expense,” said Cyber Foreign Office Minister Tariq Ahmad in a statement.

In a statement on Friday, the Iran Foreign Ministry condemned the sanctions: “Indubitably, the US will not be able to use such ploys to stop or prevent Iranian people’s scientific progress,” said Bahram Qassemi on the Iran Foreign Ministry’s website.

Tensions are heating up between Iran and U.S. around cybersecurity. In September, FireEye claimed that an Iranian group called APT33 was behind a cyberespionage campaign – also using the spear phishing method –  targeting aerospace, petrochemical and energy sector firms in the U.S., as well as Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

Moving forward, it’s critical for universities and institutions to prioritize proper cyber security practices as cyberespionage practices ramp up, said Orlando.

“Nation-state hackers will attack anyone and anything they think will help them infiltrate our institutions and infrastructure, so this is a clear call for everyone to get serious about cyber hygiene and realize they, too, can be a target,” said Orlando."

One well crafted phishing message sent via Facebook Messenger ensnared 10 million Facebook users and counting.

For months now, millions of Facebook users have been duped by the same phishing scam that cons users into handing over their account credentials.

According to a report outlining the phishing campaign, the scam is still active and continues to push victims to a fake Facebook login page where victims are enticed to submit their Facebook credentials. Unconfirmed estimates suggest nearly 10 million users fell prey to the scam, earning a single perpetrator behind the phishing ploy a huge payday.

According to a report published by researchers at PIXM Security, the phishing campaign began last year and ramped up in September. Researchers believe millions of Facebook users were exposed each month by the scam. Researchers assert that the campaign remains active.

Facebook has not replied to requests for comment for this report.

Infosec Insiders Newsletter

PIXM asserts the campaign is tied to a single person located in Colombia. The reason PIXM believes the massive Facebook scam is tied to a single individual is because each message links back to code “signed” with a reference to a personal website. Researchers state the individual went so far as responding to researcher inquiries.

How the Scam Worked
The crux of the phishing campaign centers around a fake Facebook login page. It might not look immediately suspicious, as it copies Facebook’s user interface closely.

When a victim enters their credentials and clicks “Log In,” those credentials are sent to the attacker’s server. Then, “in a likely automated fashion,” the authors of the report explained, “the threat actor would login to that account, and send out the link to the user’s Friends via Facebook Messenger.”

Any Friends that click the link are brought to the fake login page. If they fall for it the credential-stealing message is forwarded to their Friends.

Post-credential phish, victims are redirected to pages with advertisements, which also in many instances also included surveys. Each of these pages generates referral revenue for the attacker, researchers said.

When researchers reached out to the individual taking claim for the phishing campaign the individual “claimed to make $150 for every thousand visits [to the advertising exit page] from the United States.”

PIXM estimates nearly 400 million U.S.-based page views of the exit page. This, researchers said, “would put this threat actor’s projected revenue at $59M from Q4 2021 to present.” However, researchers don’t believe the criminal is being honest about their earnings, adding they are “probably exaggerating quite a bit.”

How the Scam Bypassed Security
The perpetrator of this campaign managed to circumvent the social media platform’s security checks by utilizing a technique that Facebook didn’t catch, PIXM said.

When a victim clicks on a malicious link in Messenger, the browser initiates a chain of redirects. The first redirect points to a legitimate “app deployment” service. “After the user has clicked,” the report’s authors explained, “they will be redirected to the actual phishing page. But, in terms of what lands on Facebook, it’s a link generated using a legitimate service that Facebook could not outright block without blocking legitimate apps and links as well.”

Even if Facebook caught on to and blocked any one of these illegitimate domains, “it was trivial (and based on the speed we observed, likely automated) to spin up a new link using the same service, with a new unique ID. We would often observe several used in a day, per service,” researchers said.

PIXM said it was able to access the hacker’s own pages for tracking the campaigns. The data indicated that nearly 2.8 million people fell for the scam in 2021 and 8.5 million have so far this year.

Researchers warn, “As long as these domains remain undetected by use of legitimate services, these phishing tactics will continue to flourish.”"
Email Phishing,"FBI Warns of Spike in W-2 Phishing Campaigns

A recent FBI public service advisory warned of an increase in reports of compromised or spoofed emails involving W-2 forms.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning businesses about a spike in phishing campaigns requesting W-2 information from payroll personnel.

In a recent security advisory the FBI warned it has seen an increase since January in reports of compromised or spoofed emails involving W-2 forms. These emails, coming during the IRS’s tax filing season, can put staffers’ social security numbers and other important personal information at risk, it said.

“This scam is just one of several new variations of IRS and tax-related phishing campaigns targeting W-2 information, indicating an increase in the interest of criminals in sensitive tax information,” said the FBI’s advisory.

The FBI said recent scams include attackers impersonating an executive from inside a targeted organization that seeks to obtain W-2 information from an HR professional.

Separately, the Internal Revenue Service warned of similar W-2 -related phishing attacks in a January advisory. “The Form W-2 scam has emerged as one of the most dangerous phishing emails in the tax community,” the IRS noted.

In several reported cases to the IRS, after the fraudsters acquired the workforce information, they immediately followed up with a request for a wire transfer. Because of the nature of these scams, the IRS said that some businesses and organizations did not realize for days, weeks or months that they had been scammed.

“As all threats do, these W-2 scams continue to evolve, and we’ll see a ramp up in a major way from when people expect to receive their W-2s up until tax day in April,” Troy Gill, Manager of security research at AppRiver, told Threatpost. “Precautions start with just basic best practices and hygiene in terms of email security. It goes a long way to just get in the practice of not opening an attachment from an unknown sender.”

One safeguard for businesses is to maintain a file, preferably in non-electronic form, of vendor contact information for those who are authorized to approve changes in payment instructions, suggests the FBI. Businesses can also delay any transactions until additional verifications can be performed – including having staff wait to be contacted by the bank to verify the wire transfer.

Phishing scams related W-2 information have been increasing overall – according to the IRS. Reports regarding this particular scam from both victims and non-victims jumped to approximately 900 in 2017, compared to slightly over 100 in 2016. The IRS also said that in 2017, more than 200 employers were victimized, “which translated into hundreds of thousands of employees who had their identities compromised.”"

A new variant of the banking trojan Dridex is part of a sophisticated phishing attack targeting users of the cloud-based accounting firm Xero.

A new variant of the banking trojan Dridex is part of a sophisticated phishing attack targeting users of the cloud-based accounting firm Xero.

The global campaign is the latest in what security experts at Trustwave said is a wave of phishing attacks against Xero and other financial and accounting services such as Intuit.

As part of the campaign, attackers are spoofing messages that appear to be originating from Xero, an accounting company based in New Zealand that sells cloud-based accounting services to small and medium-sized businesses. Messages contain malicious links that attempt to trick recipients into downloading Zip archives containing a JavaScript file.

“On execution, this JavaScript downloads and launches banking malware on to the victim’s computer that steals their personal and private information and leaves them vulnerable to the mercy of their attackers,” said Trustwave researchers Fahim Abbasi and Rodel Mendrez who coauthored a report on the campaign published Wednesday.

The subject line of messages is typically “Xero Billing Notifications” with the originating email address displaying “xeronet.org” instead of the legit business “xero.com.” The domain was registered in China the same day the campaign started (Aug. 16). The message body attempts to spoof a legitimate inquiry from Xero, requesting the recipient to follow a set of malicious URLs. (see below)

“Browsing to either URL has the same result, the URLs load JavaScript into the browser that forces a ZIP file download on to the victim’s computer,” researchers said. Unzipping Xero Invoice.zip extracts to Xero Invoice.js.

“On further analysis, it appears to be a generic JavaScript downloader and executer, that employs the Microsoft ActiveX object MSXML2.XMLHTTP to download the malware payload. This object is used to send an arbitrary HTTP request, receive the response, and have the Microsoft XML Document Object Model (DOM) parse that response,” researchers wrote.

The malware payload is identified as “Y739Ayh.exe,” a variant of the Dridex banking trojan. Trustwave call it a “sophisticated malware sample” capable of gathering system information such as installed applications and user account details. The malware also preforms several system wide policy settings and configuration changes for Internet Explorer through the registry. The malware also attempts to hook benign Windows processes such as “whoami.exe” and “net.exe”.

“When executed, Y739Ayh.exe performs a Process Hollowing technique to inject its malicious code into a legitimate process. It creates a suspended process of either of the two target processes: ‘svchost.exe’ or ‘spoolsv.exe’, using the API CreateProcessInternalW(),” researchers wrote. After the malicious code is written the main executable (Y739Ayh.exe) is then deleted.

“The malware probes the infected system by gathering computer name, system information as well as privilege information and integrity level. It uses built in Windows commands such as ‘whoami.exe /all’ and ‘net.exe view’ and then saves the result to a .tmp file dropped in Windows %Temp% folder which is later ex-filtrated,” according to researchers.

Information is stored as XML format and is then encrypted and exfiltrated to a control server using several different nonstandard ports using encrypted SSL channels.

“Dridex is designed to steal banking and personal information by injecting itself into web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. It monitors browsing activity and steals sensitive information for target online banks listed in its configuration file,” Trustwave wrote.

The number of Dridex banking malware campaigns has fluctuated over the past year. In January, Dridex campaigns were on the upswing after an extended six-month hiatus. According to security firm Flashpoint, the Trojan began targeting large financial institutions in the U.K with a new technique that can bypass Windows User Account Control (UAC).

In February, researchers with IBM X-Force identified the new Dridex v4 sample sporting a new injection method for evading detection based on the technique known as AtomBombing. In April, Microsoft patched a zero-day vulnerability that was being used to spread the Dridex banking Trojan.

In each of the cases campaigns focused on banks and large financial institutions in the U.K.

Attacks targeting Xero customers follow a string of related campaigns targeting customers of online financial software services companies. In many cases, phishing emails used Microsoft SharePoint for hosting malicious URLs – as the Xero campaign did.

“Our research suggests that based on matching whois info, the cybercriminals behind this fresh wave of phishing attacks have been active in the past with similar campaigns using domains,” researchers said. Those similar campaigns began on Aug. 20 and included links to domains: xeroaccounting[.]org , intuito[.]biz, quickbooks-support[.]biz, financialaccountant[.]info, myobaustralia[.]org, australiangovernments[.]com, btconnect[.]biz and drvenergy[.]com.

“Such attacks have emerged as a recent trend on the attack landscape that exploit the trust that people associate with specific brands. As a mitigation measure, customers should avoid opening any email messages that appear suspicious, especially avoid opening any unknown downloaded files,” wrote Abbasi and Mendrez."

phishing,"Researchers Find Phishing Site Encrypted with AES

A phishing site seeking Apple credentials and victim payment card information is encrypted with AES, researchers at Ring 0 Labs said.

Scammers chasing Apple credentials and payment card information have ramped up their efforts to hide their phishing page by encrypting it with AES.

Researchers at Ring 0 Labs disclosed details about the operation last week, pointing out that the criminals behind this activity are buffering a fairly weak email campaign with a technique adept at side-stepping website scanners and reputation services that might flag the site as malicious.

“This technique uses AES encryption instead of B64 or simple XOR routines write new content to the page at load time,” said a Ring 0 Labs representative in an email to Threatpost. “Since this is a newer technique, it can be fairly effective at avoiding scanning services and crawlers that aim to detect these types of sites. But like anything, these services will surely catch on to this technique and adapt accordingly.”

It’s unknown how widespread this campaign is; Ring 0 Labs said a sample of the phishing email was submitted anonymously. The use of AES in this manner is a first, Ring 0 Labs said.

“Encrypting the page isn’t very different than Base64 encoding the contents of the page and using an eval statement to write a new DOM tree at load time,” Ring 0 Labs said. “While this encryption technique is very cool to me (simply because I haven’t seen it in the wild before), URL scanning services will surely catch on to this emerging technique and modify their scanning techniques to detect this activity.”

The email sample entices the victim to open an attachment with a message about a recent purchase made through Apple. The attachment purports to be a receipt from Apple sent as a Microsoft Office PowerPoint document. Ring 0 Labs’ analysis shows there are two URLs shortened using the Twitter and bit.ly shortening services. One of the shortened URLs, done so with Twitter’s service, resolves to another site shortened with the bit.ly service before ultimately redirecting to the phishing site.

“The email itself is not very convincing. The user who submitted the file stated that the original email text was poorly written English,” Ring 0 Labs said. “The email also claimed to be from Apple and stated that the user’s ‘receipt’ is in the attached PowerPoint document. This is obviously very odd behavior.

“The contents of the PowerPoint document looked like a semi-legitimate receipt from Apple (and all the math added up correctly I believe.) The real convincing part is the website design. It is spot on for color, grammar, and layout and appears to be a real Apple portal.”

The site is not only convincing, but it’s contained within a single variable that is AES encrypted, Ring 0 Labs said. The page is decrypted as it loads a function called AES.Ctr.decrypt; this allows the page to bypass signature scanning services, the researchers said.

Ring 0 Labs said it believes the AES encryption helps the phishing site avoid automated reputation crawlers that scan pages for malicious content and essentially blacklist these sites.

“By using this AES encryption technique the site is able to remain hidden for a little longer without detection by these systems,” Ring 0 Labs said in its report. “There are numerous techniques to obfuscate webpages with JavaScript and other methods. I have seen a ton of these techniques, but this just happens to be one that I have not seen before.”

The phishing site asks the victim to log in with their Apple credentials and then presents a message to the user that their account is locked and additional information is required to retrieve the account. The victim then is asked a number of questions whose intent is to retrieve personal information before asking for payment card information."
Email Phishing,"Curiosity Kills Security When it Comes to Phishing

The results of an academic experiment reveal that recipients of Facebook messages are much more likely to click on suspicious links.

Regardless of the amount of training and technology applied to phishing prevention, people are going to click on links, trust messages from supposedly known sources and get into trouble online.

A recent academic paper collates the results of an experiment conducted with more than 1,200 German university students on the factors contributing to their willingness to click on a link in a message sent to them, either an email or a Facebook message.

The experiment described in the paper, “Unpacking Spear Phishing Susceptibility,” written by Zinaida Benenson, Freya Gassmann, and Robert Landwirth of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg and the Universitat des Saarlandes of Germany, concludes that curiosity is the No. 1 reason users are likely to interact with the contents of a message. This flies in the face of a decade’s-worth of awareness training and dire stories of nation-states infiltrating the highest levels of government with a well-crafted email or social media message.

“These results show that people’s decisional heuristics are relatively easy to misuse in a targeted attack, making defense especially challenging,” the researchers wrote.

The experiment was first described last summer during a talk at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas.


Phishing remains the most reliable means of gaining a foothold on an internal network. Attackers are adept at spoofing the sender’s email address, know to whom messages should be crafted and how, and understand that a personalized message and a logo familiar to the target are often enough to get inside the firewall of an organization.

The results presented in this paper, however, may indicate that phishers may be working too hard.

The 1,255 students were, in January 2014, sent either email or Facebook messages in the academic experiment. The message promised a link from a phony person about pictures from a phony party. Those who clicked were shown an “Access Denied” message and their clicks rates were recorded in the background. The researchers used 280 Facebook users and 975 email users with a comparable genders and ages. The researchers’ hypothesis that message reception via Facebook would correlate to a higher success rate was corroborated, more so than four other hypotheses described in the paper.

In this experiment, 42.5 percent of Facebook users clicked on the link messaged to them while 20 percent of email users clicked. The researchers then asked the participants open-ended questions giving them the opportunity to explain why they clicked.

“By far the most frequent reason was ‘Curiosity,'” the researchers wrote. “These participants explained that they knew that the pictures cannot be for them, but were interested in the supposedly funny or private content.”

The next most popular reason was that some sort of context around the message applied to the user, such as the possibility of knowing someone who attended the fictional party. Other users posited they may have known the sender, or were confident that existing security such as antivirus would protect them.

For every reason users clicked, there were similar reasons why they did not. Those who didn’t most frequently opted not to because the sender was unknown to them or there was a strong assumption the message was phishing or some other type of fraud. Others were skeptical of the context of the message that it did not fit their personal experience, for example, while others are more privacy or security conscious and don’t click on links by rule.

Regardless, the susceptibility of Facebook users to click on links certainly stood out to the researchers.

“The special characteristics of the Facebook platform, such as informal communication and easy ways to find the profile of a recent acquaintance, might have made our message especially plausible there,” they wrote. They also said that users handle messages on Facebook differently than they would email, and that could be a contributing factor. For example, users scan notifications quickly and may not pay attention to certain details as they would in an email.

The academics also point out that vigilance against phishing may have unintended consequences. For examples, a number of current spam and phishing campaigns are using invoices as lures. But extra care with such attachments might mean that a user misses one, and this could begin to negatively affect job performance.

“Under these circumstances, the employees are likely to disregard this kind of user education attempts, because the only way for them to get their job done in time is to process their emails as quickly as possible, without ‘wasting’ time with extra security checks,” they wrote."
Email Phishing,"Rash Of Phishing Attacks Use HTTPS To Con Victims

Phishing sites are deploying freely available TLS certificates in order to dupe victims into thinking they’re visiting a safe site.

Scammers are increasingly abusing consumer awareness of sites that encrypt data sent over the internet using HTTPS, particularly through a spike in phishing attacks that hope to win the confidence of victims by using the protocol on spoofed sites.

“For quite a while now, the security community has been educating users about the importance of secured communication. Users have been taught that important connections will be secured with HTTPS,” wrote Anna Shirokova and Ivan Nikolaev, researchers with the Cisco Talos team, who Thursday explained the HTTPS phishing problem in a report.

Raised awareness has created a “strange side-effect” where consumers trust anything secured with HTTPS, they said, adding that trust is increasingly being abused by scammers especially through phishing attacks.

“During our analysis, we have observed domains being used for phishing, as well as by scammers, offering fake technical support and by advertisers promoting products of questionable quality,” they wrote.

Attackers are impersonating well-known domains such as Apple.com, Facebook.com, Microsoft.com and PayPal.com, and sign phony sites they use as phishing domains, such as apple.com-133[.]com and facebook.com-secured[.]com, with legitimate certificates.

“This means that the users who visit the domain and look at the URL will see the little green lock. Rarely will anyone check the actual certificate,” Shirokova and Nikolaev said.

Phishing emails often link to spoofed sites, and when they are viewed in a mobile browser or inside a narrow browser window, often the only thing the target sees is HTTPS in the URL and the first half of a spoofed domain such as Microsoft.com-pl-lot1[.]oficjalne-prezenty-gadzet[.]top.

Researchers said attackers are taking advantage of certificate authorities such as Let’s Encrypt which provides certificates for free, no questions asked.

“We acknowledge there is a problem here, but the solutions are not very clear cut,” said Josh Aas, the executive director of Let’s Encrypt in an interview with Threatpost. He points out that Let’s Encrypt’s primary mission is to prevent surveillance and censorship on the web.

Aas said, certificate authorities should not subjectively prohibit domains from getting certificates because it would be essentially censoring the web as HTTPS becomes more mandatory.

Phishing sites abusing SSL and TLS certificates is nothing new. Last month, a report by The SSL Store said last year 15,270 free SSL certificates were issued to sites that contained the word “PayPal” in the domain name or the certificate identity. It claimed 97 percent were issued to phishing sites.

“The crux of the problem is this green lock and what people think it means. It means the connection is encrypted, not that the content of the site is safe,” Aas said. “Browsers are over-promising. What we need is content awareness.”

For now, the best course of action, according to Aas, is to rely on frameworks such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Smartscreen becasue they have the ability to block sites reported to them as unsafe."
AiTM phishing,"DocuSign Phishing Campaign Includes Hancitor Downloader

DocuSign warns of a breach and subsequent theft of email addresses that are part of a phishing campaign that employs malicious macro-laced Word documents.

Electronic document exchange vendor DocuSign warned on Monday of a wave of phishing emails targeting its customers with links to malicious Word documents. The campaign, it said, was tied to an earlier breach of its computer networks where hackers were able to gain “temporary access” and exfiltrate an undisclosed number of customer email addresses.

DocuSign, with 100 million users and 250,000 business accounts, said “no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information” were stolen by the hackers.

Phishing emails spoofed the DocuSign brand and included a hyperlink to a Word document that contained a malicious macro. If the document is downloaded and the macro is enabled, it delivers the Hancitor downloader. Next, Hancitor downloads either the credential stealing Pony, EvilPony or ZLoader malware, said Gregor Perotto, senior director, global corporate marketing and communications for DocuSign.

Earlier this year, researchers had reported a lull in the distribution of spam spreading information-stealing malware via Hancitor. That dry spell ended in January when SANS Internet Storm Center noted a sharp increase in spam containing links to download Word documents with macros that, if enabled, downloaded Hancitor.

The DocuSign malicious email campaign began last week, according to the company. That’s when DocuSign said it began tracking emails that featured the subject line “Completed: docusign.com – Wire Transfer Instructions for recipient-name Document Ready for Signature”.

On Monday, DocuSign again reached out to customers informing them that it was continuing to track the malicious email campaign and that the subject line changed. It now read, “Completed *company name* – Accounting Invoice *number* Document Ready for Signature”, according to the company. Emails also had links to downloadable Word documents that contained Hancitor. Spoofed sender email address included @docusign.com or @docusign.net domains, DocuSign said.

“As part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email. A complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed,” the company said.

It reiterated that the breach did not impact the privacy of customer documents sent through DocuSign’s eSignature platform. It is encouraging customers who receive malicious emails to forward them to spam@docusign.com.

Still unknown is how many DocuSign email addresses were stolen.

Security experts report incidents of macro-based malware have steadily been on the rise in 2016. In the enterprise, Microsoft reports, 98 percent of Office-targeted threats still use old-school macro-based attacks.

The increase in macro-based attacks began earlier last summer, and criminals have been increasingly turning to Office macros to deliver malware versus using more traditional means such as exploit kits."
