       " 'Analysts have uncovered an Iran-linked APT sending malicious emails to top Israeli government officials.',\n",
       " 'An advanced persistent threat group, with ties to Iran, is believed behind a phishing campaign targeting high-profile government and military Israeli personnel, according to a report by Check Point Software.',\n",
       " 'Targets of the campaign included a senior leadership in the Israeli defense industry, the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Israel.',\n",
       " 'The goal of the campaign, the researchers said, was to obtain personal information from targets.',\n",
       " 'Fake Emails from Legit Addresses',\n",
       " 'One of the targets, according to Check Point, is Tzipi Livni, Israel’s former foreign minister, minister of justice and vice prime minister. Researchers believe that the target was selected because of the high-caliber list of contacts in her address book.',\n",
       " 'Not long ago she received an email from, according to the researchers, “a well-known former Major General in the IDF who served in a highly sensitive position.” The sender address was not spoofed – it was the same domain she’d corresponded with before. Translated from Hebrew, the message read:',\n",
       " 'Hello my dear friends, Please see attached article to summarize the year. ((*eyes only*)) Of course I don’t want it to be distributed, because it is not the final version. I would be happy to receive remarks of any kind. Have a great rest of the day.',\n",
       " 'The message contained a link. Livni delayed in clicking the link, prompting several follow-up emails.',\n",
       " 'Good morning, I haven’t heard from you. Some friends sent me remarks. Your remarks are also very important to me. I know you are very busy. But I wanted to ask you to take your time and read the article. Good week',\n",
       " 'The persistence of the sender and flurry of messages raised her suspicions, according to Check Point. After Livni met with the former Major General, it became clear that the emails were sent from a compromised account and the contents of the messages were part of a phishing attack.',\n",
       " 'It was a similar story for the other targets in this campaign – suspect emails were being sent from legitimate contacts.',\n",
       " 'What Really Happened',\n",
       " 'The method of attack wasn’t particularly technical. “The most sophisticated part of the operation is the social engineering,” Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Research, noted. He said, the campaign was “a very targeted phishing chain that is specifically crafted for each target.” Personally crafted phishing emails is a technique called spear phishing.',\n",
       " 'The attackers initiated their spear phishing attacks, first by compromising an email address book belonging to a contact of their target. Then, using the hijacked account, they’d continue an already existing email chain between the contact and the target. In time, they’d steer the conversation towards conning the target to clicking on or opening a malicious link or document.',\n",
       " '“Some of the emails include a link to a real document that is relevant to the target,” Check Point’s analysts noted. For example, an “invitation to a conference or research, phishing page of Yahoo, link to upload document scans.”',\n",
       " '“The goal,” in the end, was “to steal their personal information, passport scans, and steal access to their mail accounts.”',\n",
       " 'Who and Why',\n",
       " '“We have solid evidence that it started at least from December 2021,” Shykevich wrote, “but we assume that it started earlier.”',\n",
       " 'In their analysis, the researchers found evidence they believe points to the Iran-linked Phosphorus APT group (a.k.a. Charming Kitten, Ajax Security, NewsBeef, APT35). Phosphorus is one of Iran’s most active APTs, with “a long history of conducting high-profile cyber operations, aligned with the interest of the Iranian regime, as well as targeting Israeli officials.”',\n",
       " 'Iran and Israel are usually at odds, and these attacks came “in the midst of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. With recent assassinations of Iranian officials (some affiliated with the Israeli’s Mossad), and the thwarted attempts to kidnap Israeli citizens worldwide, we suspect that Phosphorous will continue with its ongoing efforts in the future.”',\n",

       " 'Attackers used adversary-in-the-middle attacks to steal passwords, hijack sign-in sessions and skip authentication and then use victim mailboxes to launch BEC attacks against other targets.',\n",
       " 'Microsoft researchers have uncovered a massive phishing campaign that can steal credentials even if a user has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled and has so far attempted to compromise more than 10,000 organizations.',\n",
       " 'The campaign, which has been active since September 2021, depends upon the use of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing sites in the initial attacks to hijack session cookies and steal credentials. From there, attackers can access victims’ user mailboxes to launch further attacks against other targets, the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MTIC) wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.',\n",
       " 'Infosec Insiders Newsletter',\n",
       " 'In AiTM attacks, a threat actor deploys a proxy server between a target user and the website the user wishes to visit–that is, the site the attacker wishes to impersonate, researchers explained.',\n",
       " '“Such a setup allows the attacker to steal and intercept the target’s password and the session cookie that proves their ongoing and authenticated session with the website,” they wrote.',\n",
       " 'It’s important to point out that this type of attack does not denote a vulnerability in the type of MFA employed by a corporate email system, they added. AiTM phishing steals the session cookie, so the attacker gets authenticated to a session on the user’s behalf regardless of the sign-in method the latter uses, researchers said.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, attackers are getting wise to organizations’ increasing use of MFA to better secure user accounts and creating more sophisticated phishing attacks like these that can bypass it, noted a security professional.',\n",
       " '“While MFA is certainly valuable and should be used when possible, by capturing the password and session cookie–and because the session cookie shows that MFA was already used to login–the attackers can often circumvent the need for MFA when they login to the account again later using the stolen password,” observed Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at security awareness training firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.',\n",
       " 'AiTM Phishing, Unpacked',\n",
       " 'In their observation of the campaign, Microsoft researchers took a deeper dive into how these types of attacks work and how they can be used to mount secondary business email compromise (BEC) attacks once initial access to someone’s account is gained, they said.',\n",
       " 'AiTM phishing attacks depend upon the session that every modern web service implements with a user after successful authentication so that the user doesn’t have to be authenticated at every new page they visit, researchers explained.',\n",
       " '“This session functionality is implemented through a session cookie provided by an authentication service after initial authentication,” they wrote. “The session cookie is proof for the web server that the user has been authenticated and has an ongoing session on the website.”',\n",
       " 'In AiTM phishing, an attacker attempts to steal a target user’s session cookie so they can skip the whole authentication process and act as if they are the legitimate authenticated user, researchers said.',\n",
       " '“To do this, the attacker deploys a webserver that proxies HTTP packets from the user that visits the phishing site to the target server the attacker wishes to impersonate and the other way around,” they wrote. “This way, the phishing site is visually identical to the original website (as every HTTP is proxied to and from the original website).”',\n",
       " 'This attack is especially convenient for threat actors because it precludes the need for them to craft their own phishing sites such as the ones used in conventional phishing campaigns, researchers noted.',\n",
       " 'Specific Attack Vector',\n",
       " 'In the phishing campaign observed by Microsoft researchers, attackers initiate contact with potential victims by sending emails with an HTML file attachment to multiple recipients in different organizations. The messages claim that the recipients have a voicemail message and need to click on the attachment to access it or it will be deleted in 24 hours.',\n",
       " 'If a user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a site that tells them they will be redirected again to their mailbox with the audio in an hour. Meanwhile, they are asked to sign in with their credentials.',\n",
       " 'At this point, however, the attack does something unique using clever coding by automatically filling in the phishing landing page with the user’s email address, “thus enhancing its social engineering lure,” researchers noted.',\n",
       " 'If a target enters his or her credentials and gets authenticated, he or she is redirected to the legitimate Microsoft office.com page. However, in the background, the attacker intercepts the credentials and gets authenticated on the user’s behalf, providing free reign to perform follow-on activities, researchers said.',\n",
       " 'In the phishing email chain that researchers observed, the threat actor used the authentication to commit payment fraud in secondary attacks from within the organization, researchers said.',\n",
       " 'Follow-Up BEC and Payment Fraud',\n",
       " 'Attackers took less than five minutes after hijacking sessions and stealing credentials to begin the process of conducting payment fraud by authenticating to Outlook to access finance-related emails and file attachments, researchers said. The following day, they accessed these emails and files every few hours to search for opportunities to commit fraud.',\n",
       " 'The threat actor also deleted from the compromised account’s Inbox folder the original phishing email they sent to hide traces of their initial access, researchers added.',\n",
       " '“These activities suggest the attacker attempted to commit payment fraud manually,” they wrote.',\n",
       " 'Attackers also used Outlook Web Access (OWA) on a Chrome browser to commit payment fraud while using the compromised account’s stolen session cookie, researchers added.',\n",

The email instructs the recipient to call a number provided so this can be done, which is when the malicious activity occurs.',\n",
       " 'Though researchers were not able to identify the malware variant being used in the campaign, they believe with high likelihood that it will include “common legitimate remote administration tools (RATs) for initial access, off-the-shelf penetration testing tools for lateral movement, and the deployment of ransomware or data extortion,” they wrote.',\n",
       " 'Potential to Spread Ransomware',\n",
       " 'Researchers also assessed with “moderate confidence” that callback operators in the campaign “will likely use ransomware to monetize their operation,” they said, “as 2021 BazarCall campaigns would eventually lead to Conti ransomware,” they said.',\n",

Its subject: “IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022.” It contained a macros-enabled Microsoft Excel (.xls) spreadsheet titled “list of persons.xlsx” that, when opened, delivered malware called SunSeed.',\n",

Oddly enough, the researchers were able to trace the address to a publicly available procurement document for a Stihl-brand lawn mower, purchased back in 2016. The order was made by “Військова частина А2622,” a military unit based in Chernihiv, Ukraine. Exactly how the attackers obtained access to a military email address is not clear.',\n",

       " 'The file name in that campaign – “list of participants of the briefing.xls.” – bears striking resemblance to the one used in this new campaign. Furthermore, “the Lua script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected victim’s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages.”',\n",

According to Mandiant, the group is based in Minsk, connected to the Belarusian military, and conducts its business in the interests of the Belarusian government. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.',\n",
       " 'The researchers concluded with a disclaimer. On balancing “responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence,” they wrote, “the onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators.”',\n",

       " 'A new business email compromise (BEC) campaign targeting Microsoft 365 users is using a range of sophisticated obfuscation tactics within phishing emails that can fool natural language processing filters and are undetectable to end users.',\n",
       " 'Researchers at Avanan, a CheckPoint company, first discovered the campaign – dubbed One Font because of the way it hides text in a one-point font size within messages – in September.',\n",
       " 'Attackers also are hiding links within the cascading style sheets (CSS) in their phishing emails: another tactic that serves to confuse natural language filters like Microsoft’s Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers said in a report posted online Thursday.',\n",
       " 'Register now for our LIVE event!',\n",
       " 'The One Font campaign also includes messages with links coded within the <font> tag, which – in combination with the other obfuscation techniques – also destroy the effectiveness of email filters that depend on natural language for their analysis, according to Jeremy Fuchs, a cybersecurity researcher at Avanan.',\n",
       " '“This breaks semantic analysis, which leads many solutions to treat it as a marketing email, as opposed to phishing,” Fuchs wrote. “Natural language filters see random text; human readers see what the attackers want them to see.”',\n",
       " 'The recent campaign is similar to one Avanan researchers discovered in 2018 called ZeroFont, which used similar tactics to get past Microsoft NLP in its Office 365 security protections. That campaign inserted hidden text with the font size of zero within messages to trip up email scanners that depend on natural language to weed out malicious emails.',\n",
       " 'Like that campaign, One Font also targets Office 365 organizations and can lead to BEC and ultimately endanger the corporate network if the messages aren’t flagged and users are duped into giving up their credentials, researchers said.',\n",
       " 'Obfuscation Sophistication',\n",
       " 'Indeed, since the ZeroFont campaign, cybercriminals have gotten increasingly sophisticated in their tactics to slip past the NLP used in common email filters, researchers said. Other techniques that Avanan researchers have observed include redirect tactics like meta refresh that can disrupt NLP and bypass Microsoft SafeLinks, they said.',\n",
       " 'Once it makes it to inboxes appearing to be a legitimate message, the One Font campaign uses typical phishing social-engineering tactics to get people’s attention. Attackers present what looks like a password-expiration notice, using urgent messaging to spur a potential victim into clicking on a malicious link.',\n",
       " 'That link carries them to a phishing page where they appear to be entering their credentials so they can change their passwords. Instead, threat actors are stealing their credentials to use for other cybercriminal activity, researchers said.',\n",
       " 'In their post, researchers demonstrated how specific phishing emails used a combination of tactics – specifically, links hidden within the CSS and links slipped within the <font> tag and then sized down to zero – that together confound natural language filters.',\n",
       " 'Because such obfuscation techniques are invisible to the end user, flagging such messages as malicious can be tricky, Fuchs noted. To avoid these messages slipping past filters, researchers recommend that organizations use a multi-tiered security solution that combines advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as static layers like domain and sender reputation, he wrote.',\n",
       " 'Using a security architecture that relies on more than one factor to block email and requiring corporate users to confirm with an IT department before engaging with any email that asks for a password change also can serve to mitigate attacks, Fuchs wrote.',\n",

The context of this attack also leverages the curiosity effect, which is a cognitive bias that refers to our innate desire to resolve uncertainty and know more about something.',\n",
       " 'It’s easy to see how getting an email that somebody bothered to encrypt could pique recipients’ curiosity. A May 2021 report from Security Advisor found that the curiosity effect – the desire to resolve uncertainty – has shown up as one of the top three cognitive biases to be exploited in phishing attacks, appearing in 17 percent of such attacks.',\n",
       " 'Brand impersonation: The email has HTML stylings and content disclaimers similar to real emails from Zix. While not a perfect replica of the real thing, it bears enough resemblance to a legitimate email to be dangerous.',\n",
       " 'Exploiting legitimate domain: The parent domain of the email sender was a deprecated or old version of a legitimate domain – ‘thefullgospelbaptist[.]com’. This helped the email bypass authentication checks.',\n",
       " 'Armorblox researcher Abhishek Iyer told Threatpost on Monday that using legitimate (if unrelated) domains to send emails “is more about tricking security controls (i.e. bypassing authentication checks) than it is about tricking recipients, especially if the domains are not spoofed to look like the real thing.”',\n",
       " 'An example that Armorblox came across last year was a Verizon credential phishing campaign where the page was hosted on the website of a Wiccan coven. Another example: an Amazon credential phishing campaign where the email was sent from the domain of Blomma Flicka Flowers, a small floral design company based out of Vermont. The campaign aimed to lift credentials and other personal information under the guise of Amazon package-delivery notices.',\n",
       " '“Whether these domains are used to send the email or host the phishing page, the attackers’ intent is to evade security controls based on URL/link protection and get past filters that block known bad domains,” Iyer said via email.',\n",
       " 'Needless to say, the legitimate Baptist organization had nothing to do with the Zix campaign, he continued. “To host phishing pages on legitimate domains, attackers usually exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or the Content Management Systems (CMS) to host the pages without the website admins knowing about it.”',\n",
       " 'Replicating existing workflows: The context for the email attack replicates workflows that already exist in our daily work lives (getting encrypted email notifications). When we see emails we’ve already seen before, our brains tend to employ System 1 thinking and take quick action. The email content even had every victim’s first name filled in to increase the feeling of legitimacy and the chances of follow through.',\n",
       " '“System 1 thinking” is a reference to Daniel Kahneman’s book, “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” which delves into our brains’ two information processing and decision making systems, System 1 being “the automatic, unconscious, and fast mode of thinking, offering little to no rationale behind its actions.” System 2 thinking is what we need when we look into our inboxes: That’s the “slow, methodical, and analytical mode of thinking, skeptical and rational by default,” Armorblox explained.',\n",

       " 'If a user clicks on the link, the page appears familiar to anyone using Google Docs to share documents outside the organization, Fuchs said.',\n",
       " '“This, however, isn’t that page,” he wrote. “It’s a custom HTML page made to look like that familiar Google Docs share page.”',\n",

       " 'Attack Hosted by Google',\n",
       " 'The trick to creating the attack vector is that the heavy lifting of the campaign is done by Google Docs, making it “quite simple to execute,” Fuchs explained.',\n",
       " 'First an attacker would write a web page that resembles a Google Docs sharing page, and then upload that HTML file to Google Drive. Once the file is scanned, Google renders the HTML into a preview page that looks very much like a typical Google Docs page.',\n",
       " 'An attacker then can right-click on the uploaded file and open it in Google Docs, which is where the simple yet integral aspect of the attack takes place, Fuchs wrote.',\n",
       " '“This is the clever bit because if you simply click ‘Get link’ you would only see the source code of the file, not the rendered version,” he wrote. However, by manipulating Google Docs, attackers are able to successfully render the malicious page rather than deliver a page with just source code to a potential victim, which would not be effective.',\n",
       " 'Final Deployment',\n",
       " 'Researchers must take one more step to have the file render in a way that a victim will recognize by selecting “Publish to the Web” from the Google Docs “File” dropdown menu.',\n",
       " 'Then by hitting “Embed” and “Publish,” Google will provide with embed tags that are meant to be used on its own forums to render custom content but which the attacker can use—minus the iframe tags—to save the malicious link intended to be sent via the phishing campaign.',\n",
       " '“This link will now render the full HTML file as intended by the attacker and it will also contain the redirect hyperlink to the actual malicious website,” Fuchs explained.',\n",
       " 'Avanan researchers also spotted the same attack method being used by threat actors to spoof a DocuSign phishing email, he added. In this case, the “View Document” button was a published Google Docs link that actually was a fake DocuSign login page that would transmit the entered password to an attacker-controlled server via a “Log In” button, Fuchs wrote.',\n",

This use of fileless malware helped to flummox detection so that the threat actors could deliver what Mandiant called “a well coded and extensible backdoor.”',\n",
       " 'Dimiter Andonov, Senior Principal Reverse Engineer with Mandiant, told Threatpost in an email on Tuesday afternoon that the techniques employed in this new malware ecosystem – specifically, the file-less serialization on compromised systems – isn’t new, but it’s effective. “While the technique is not novel per se, few malware are known to use it and the result is that the malicious components are much harder to be detected,” Andonov says.',\n",
       " 'Mandiant assumes that the point of all this effort is profit: “The identified wide-ranging targets, across geography and industry suggests a financial crime motive,” it says.',\n",
       " 'The researchers say that Doubleback appears to be “an ongoing work in progress.” The team expects to see UNC2529 continue to compromise victims in all industries, around the world.',\n",
       " 'To keep from being pulled in by what Mandiant calls this “double trifecta,” the standard-issue “don’t click on suspicious links” advice applies, Andonov says. “As all of the phishing initial vectors depend on convincing the user to click a link or execute an attached file, the ‘don’t click on the suspicious links’ advice is the first line of defense,” he says. “In some spear-phishing campaigns the malicious email might appear to be sent by a coworker or a person who is known by the receiver, and in such cases it’s always a good practice to reach back to the sender before opening any attached files or click on a link.”',\n",

       " 'These new, sophisticated attacks are aimed at C-suite executives, their assistants and financial departments, and can work around email security and Office 365 defenses. Researchers added, most of the attacks they intercepted attempted to breach financial departments. Researchers said the attacks started last December and continued through February.',\n",
       " '“By targeting the financial departments of these companies, the attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data of third parties through invoices and billing, commonly referred to as a BEC (Business Email Compromise) attack,” researchers said in the Thursday report. “This enables the attackers to send forged invoices from legitimate email addresses to suppliers, resulting in payments being made to attacker-owned accounts.”',\n",
       " 'These threat actors also specifically look for new CEOs during their transition periods, when they’re likely onboarding for payroll and other internal systems.',\n",

Judging from the size of this campaign, there are certainly many more organizations outside of our scope that have been targeted by these malicious actors.”',\n",
       " 'Anatomy of the Attack',\n",
       " 'In one version of the campaign, targets get a spoofed Office 365 security update, sent from domains with Microsoft-themed names to make them seem even more legitimate, researchers explained. The scammers have also properly configured SPF records to get by authentication protections, they added.',\n",
       " '“In an effort to further avoid detection, the threat actors leveraged their Microsoft-imposter domains in the phishing attacks not long after they were registered,” the report explained. “This quick domain registration turnaround is a common tactic employed by scammers hoping to bait as many victims as possible before their newly registered domains are identified as phishing infrastructure.”',\n",
       " 'A sample phishing email. Credit: Area 1',\n",
       " 'Another version of the attack involves taking over other accounts to send the phishing messages. The attackers spoof email addresses of known senders to evade detection.',\n",
       " 'The goal of the phishing email is to dupe victims into clicking on the “Apply Update” button, disguised as a security update, which takes them to a spoofed Office 365 login page.',\n",
       " '“For both the HTML and HTM attachments, the credential harvesting site would automatically load in the victim’s browser once the file was opened,” researchers said.',\n",
       " 'Once deployed, the threat actors apply HTML “meta” refresh to load the credential harvesting site, which appears to be a Microsoft “Privacy Statement.” If they are duped into clicking on “Accept,” they are taken to a page that looks “identical” to the real thing, according to researchers.',\n",
       " '“In some cases, the attackers were even more stealthy by prefetching the localized Office 365 sign-in,” Area 1 said. “If the victim entered their email address, the attacker would verify it was a valid Office 365 address. In instances where the entered email address used Conditional Access, a different single sign-on (SSO), Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), etc., the phishing kit would essentially break and the victim would simply be redirected to the legitimate sign-in experience.”',\n",
       " 'After a target submits their password, the threat actors have full control of their email and any other systems where the same password was used, researchers warned.',\n",
       " 'The attackers have employed a couple of new tactics for this attack, including the use of free front-end web development tools to create the fake Microsoft pages and their use of websockets to take and send the attackers screen shots of the victim’s activity after each click.',\n",
       " '“In particular when a victim clicked the “Next” button after entering their email address and password,” the report added.',\n",
       " 'Microsoft is the Phishing Lure of Choice',\n",
       " 'What is not new is the use of Microsoft-related lures, including Office 365 and Teams in BEC attacks. Just recently, Cofense released a report which found that 45 percent of all the phishing emails sent in 2020 were Microsoft-themed.',\n",
       " '“With the number of organizations migrating to Office 365, targeting these credentials allows the threat actor to gain access to the organization as a legitimate user to go undetected,” researchers with Cofense told Threatpost. They added that they “highly recommend organizations enable [multi-factor authentication] along with their [Office 365] migration/ implementation.”',\n",
       " 'Office 365 is a treasure trove of exploitable data, because it is so widely used by a remote workforce relying on the service as a central repository for data.',\n",
       " '“SaaS platforms like Office 365 are a safe haven for attacker lateral movement, making it paramount to focus on user access to accounts and services,” Chris Morales with Vectra told Threatpost. “When security teams have solid information and expectations about SaaS platforms such as Office 365, malicious behaviors and privilege abuse are much easier to quickly identify and mitigate.”',\n",
       " 'To avoid such attacks, “when receiving an email that claims to originate from internally and requires clicking on a link or downloading an attachment, it is best practice to confirm the authenticity of the email,” Qureshi told Threatpost. “All employees should be versed in basic cybersecurity, such as refraining from clicking on external, unknown links,” he said.',\n",

       " 'While previous Twitter analysis identified this loader as a mere variant of TA800’s existing BazaLoader malware, new research cites evidence that NimzaLoader is a disparate strain — with its own separate string-decryption methods and hashing algorithm techniques.',\n",
       " 'The malware loader is unique in that it is written in the Nim programming language. The use of Nim is uncommon for malware in the threat landscape, except in rare cases, such as a Nim-based downloader recently seen being used by the Zebrocy threat group. Because of this, researchers say malware developers may be using Nim to avoid detection by defense teams who may not be familiar with the language.',\n",
       " '“Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim’s implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it,” said Dennis Schwarz and Matthew Mesa, researchers with Proofpoint on Wednesday, in a report shared with Threatpost before publication.',\n",
       " 'NimzaLoader is used as “initial-access malware” and was first discovered being distributed by the TA800 threat actor in February, said researchers. TA800 is an affiliate distributor of TrickBot and BazaLoader (also known as the BazarBackdoor, BazarCall, etc.). The campaign was spotted targeting about 100 organizations across approximately 50 verticals, Proofpoint researchers told Threatpost.',\n",

       " 'Some initial analysis of NimzaLoader by various researchers on Twitter has indicated that it may be a variant of BazaLoader, another loader used by TA800 that has the primary function of downloading and executing additional modules. But, researchers with Proofpoint pointed to evidence that they say shows NimzaLoader is not merely a BazaLoader variant: “Based on our observations of significant differences, we are tracking this as a distinct malware family,” they said.',\n",
       " 'They cited several major differences between NimzaLoader and BazaLoader: For instance, the two samples use different code-flattening obfuscators, different styles of string decryption and different XOR/rotate-based Windows API hashing algorithms, they said. Other tactics that set NimzaLoader apart include the fact that the malware doesn’t use a domain-generation algorithm and that it makes use of JSON in its command-and-control (C2) communications.',\n",

       " 'If the email recipient clicks on the link, they are redirected to a landing page hosted on email marketing service GetResponse. That page links to the “PDF” and tells the victim to “save to preview.” This link in turn actually takes the victim to the NimzaLoader executable.',\n",
       " 'NimzaLoader Malware Executable',\n",
       " 'Upon closer inspection, researchers found that NimzaLoader is developed using Nim (as evidenced by various “nim” related strings in the executable). The malware uses mostly encrypted strings, using an XOR-based algorithm and a single key per string. One encrypted string contains a timestamp and is used to set an expiration date for the malware. For instance, in one analyzed sample the expiration date was set to Feb. 10 at 1:20:55.003 p.m. – meaning the malware would not run after that date and time.',\n",
       " 'Most of the other strings contain command names. These commands include the ability to execute powershell.exe and inject a shellcode into a process as a thread. While the NimzaLoader C2 servers were down at the time of research, researchers said a public malware sandbox appeared to show the malware receiving a PowerShell command that ultimately delivered a Cobalt Strike beacon.',\n",
       " '“We are unable to validate or confirm this finding, but it does align with past TA800 tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs),” they said.',\n",
       " 'TA800 Threat Group: The Future of NimzaLoader',\n",

       " 'Many of these phishing emails may relate to invoices and transactions needed for work. One recent example of such an attack, for instance, involved invoice-themed emails sent to at least 20,000 mailboxes that purport to share information about an electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment. The emails found earlier this month carried a fairly vanilla subject line, “TRANSFER OF PAYMENT NOTICE FOR INVOICE,” and contain a link to download an “invoice” from the cloud.',\n",
       " 'These types of attacks work because “finance teams are under extreme pressure to process invoices and payments in a timely fashion to keep the business running, especially during month- or quarter-end when financial reporting is critical,” said researchers. “So, if a user hasn’t heard anything back about the email they reported, they will most likely interact with that message.”',\n",

       " 'Researchers found that in 2020, the GuLoader dropper rose as one of the top malware delivery mechanisms in email attacks.',\n",
       " 'The malware, which first appeared in the first quarter and surged during the second quarter of 2020, is used to deliver remote administration tools, keyloggers, credential stealers and other malware phenotypes.',\n",

       " 'For instance, one June email campaign was discovered targeting mid-level employees across Austria, Germany and Switzerland with malicious Excel attachments. Once opened, and with macros enabled, the Microsoft Excel attachments would then download and execute GuLoader, which in turn would download and execute the Hakbit ransomware.',\n",
       " 'The malware’s advanced techniques make it a lucrative tool for cybercriminals to utilize to sidestep network- and email-security detections. For instance, the malware contains false code instructions designed to thwart analysis tools and a wide array of tricks to avoid executing in virtual or sandbox environments, said researchers. The attackers behind the malware also store their malicious payloads on cloud platforms like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive – which because they are legitimate services, are not frequently blocked.',\n",
       " '“While GuLoader is an executable, it is normally deployed through weaponized office documents that are built to bypass security controls and download the malware directly from the victim’s computer system,” said researchers. “GuLoader’s continued evolution of sophisticated delivery and execution techniques make it increasingly useful in delivering threats.”',\n",
